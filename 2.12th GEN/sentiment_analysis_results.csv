Great for productivity, but not the best for gaming.",05-11-2022,"To be clear, the i3-12100f performs as an excellent desktop processor for what it is, and if you're going to use it mainly for office tasks, browsing, YouTube, it'll do all of that effortlessly, and efficiently so at near or around half the wattage of it's Ryzen counterpart.Once you cross into PC gaming territory, results can be mixed. You have to be very careful about which GPU is paired with this i3 to prevent noticeable bottlenecks. I tried a few combinations, given how touted this was as a such a good budget option, and while it always seemed to work decent in GPU intensive games, CPU intensive games always suffered and exhibited massive amounts of stuttering and fps drops, even if the resolution was raised to 1440p and settings favored GPU. For reference I was using higher end cards to test, such as an MSI Trio RX 6800 and an EVGA RTX 3070 FTW3, and yes, I was aware it would bottleneck to begin with, but was hoping it would not be as severe as it was to serve as a temporary fix until I could upgrade later in the year. Many reviewers also glowed about how it could be paired with more high-end GPUs, but this clearly isn't the case for some games. Fortnite is one example that suffered massively. I wouldn't recommend pairing this with anything more than an RX 6600, RTX 3060, or something slightly older such as a GTX 1660 TI."

Great for budget gaming",06-01-2023,"I'm pairing this with a 5700 XT, 16GB of DDR4 3200, and a 1TB NVME. I get a nearly locked 60fps at 4k in Forza Horizon 5 with high settings, and easily get a constant 60+ fps at 1440p with high settings in all games I play. If you're looking for a steady 60-75fps this CPU would pair well with any GPU up to a 6700xt or 3060ti in all but the most CPU intensive games (you may notice occasional dips in something like Cyberpunk). For general computing use it's more than adequate. It also run very cool using the stock cooler (doesn't go over 65Â° while gaming).For the $106 I paid I couldn't be happier, but I'll probably upgrade to an i5-12400/13400 when I get a more power GPU and/or a higher refresh rate monitor."

My system currently runs the Zorin OS (Linux) smoothly and efficiently with temperatures sometimes under 30 degrees. Just remember that with this cpu you need a graphics card as the chip does not have that component. It is a nice touch that this cpu is compatible with either DDR4 or DDR5 memory. Just check the standards for the motherboard you intend to purchase. Best of luck with building your own desktop."

Better than the Ryzen 5 5500!!!",22-10-2023,"I didnt expect much from an i3, but once again I was blinded by the label. This product holds the price to performance of a console KILLER. It's single core power is up there with the ryzen 7000 series processors, supporting ddr5 ram at only 90 dollars WITH the cooler. Assuming your average cooler is about 10 dollars, you really can't go wrong with an 84 dollar cpu capable of 500+ fps on minecraft, 300+ fps on valorant, etc.I will say though, a quad core cpu in 2023 is a bit questionable, since you'll have extra issues streaming and recording games. The cache is also pretty low for this cpu, but you really can't hate too much on a 90 dollar cpu at this magnitude of performance.Overall solid cpu, more than I need for games and editing. DONT BE BLINDED BY THE I3 LABEL, IT PERFORMS UP THERE WITH RYZEN CPUS AND 10TH GEN I7S!!!"

More power than I'll ever need",20-01-2023,"This has enough power to play ALL games.  I don't have a single one in my library that uses more than 50% of this CPU.  It plays GTA 5, satisfactory, far cry 6, cities skylines, and it can even play UEBS 2 with 4 million A.I. enemies.  I've only ever seen this hit 100% on benchmarks.Just because it's an i3, don't think it's weak.  12th gen i3's are more powerful than i7's of older generations.Don't buy the i5, i7, or i9.  This is more than enough.Update 5-25-2024This processor is still going strong and can still play modern games.  Runs sons of the forest like a champ never hitting 100%.  Unfortunately I have found 2 games this struggles to run.  Star citizen and grey zone warfare.  It is 100% the entire time on both of these games.  Grey zone warfare can still run at 80fps on ultra settings at 4k, but Star citizen bogs down so bad it's almost unplayable.  But still, even in 2024 it's still a great buy and I still recommend."

Unbelievable it performs this well",17-07-2023,The price this little quad core comes in at really is incredible. Sure it's quad core but this is not the i3 of the past (well kinda is but you know what I mean). 4.3ghz single core with 8 threads means this think is a mini gaming beast. It can do 1440p gaming (with capable card of course) and I have been doing just that. The only reason I will be moving on from it is for the 6 core i3 in 14th gen. Best believe though I will be making another inexpensive PC with this when I upgrade. I have a spare 5500xt that should make for a quality 1080p second machine for when I visit home to my mom's. 5/5 stars.

Sachez qu'elle a autant de rÃ©pondant qu'un haut de gamme d'il y a 4 ans.Pour rÃ©sumer, au regard du prix, le 12100F est ce qu'il se fait de mieux pour un ordinateur destinÃ© Ã  un usage polyvalent et Ã©conomique."

CPU OK--Cooler is Worthless",24-02-2023,So far the CPU works as expected.  The included Intel CPU cooler is completely useless.  The installation process is obscure and the mounting system is terrible.  Basically plastic pop rivets which hold the fan to the motherboard.  The cooler did not work and the CPU temperature was almost 90 C.  The motherboard would not let me load software because of the high temperature warning.  I replaced the Intel unit with an after market cooler that works very well.  CPU temperature in now in the mid 20's.  A very disappointing experience and I think that I will use AMD processors next time.

Amazing Budget CPU for gaming",09-02-2024,"I bought this CPU to put into a budget build for my girlfriend. This CPU is fantastic; she gets a solid 144fps with absolutely no frame drops under 100fps in Fortnite, Overwatch, and many others, and with the CPU being underpowered by a 1650 super I can only imagine how well it would run with something like a 3060. Also, I had read about and was expecting to have thermal issues with the stock cooler until I received the water cooler I ordered, but the cooler has had no problems keeping the CPU cool under load. The only thing I did was removed the pre-applied paste and applied some MX-6 thermal paste. Overall, great budget CPU for gaming."

good little processor",13-12-2023,6 cores are good for almost any video card on the market. Its intel. How can you go wrong now days? Intel. And who really cares as long as it is within budget of what your building? Who cares? Its just been processing for the last year. No issues. I dont overclock and I wouldn't overclock. This is my wife's PC. I dont feel like hearing the disappointment in her voice.

It RIPS!!",20-12-2022,"Iâm honestly blown away by the performance of these 12th gen Intel chips. The single core performance is amazing, which is what will be important for most users. The multi core performance is fantastic as well. I have a ânon-Fâ version in a workstation and this 12400F in a gaming rig (yes, I liked it enough to buy a second one.) Itâs great for both use cases. I have it paired with an RTX 3080ti for gaming, and most of the time the CPU load is well under 50%. My favorite game only uses 1-4% of the processor lol. For reference, I game at 4K with maxed settings on a 55â TV, so at 1080p or 1440p, there may be more load shifted to the CPU. Still, I wouldnât expect it to break a sweat under most titles, including AAA titles. Buy with confidence, and donât fall victim to anyone telling you that you need an i9 to game. Itâs just not necessary unless maybe you are a designer who wants just one computer that has the CPU horsepower for work and also can game in your spare time."

Fantastic for what it is. Solid choice for gaming.",29-06-2023,"First off if you do NOT have a dedicated GPU make sure to get the non-f version! The 12400f is a solid choice, and this is a great time to snag one. It's LGA 1700 so any motherboards that can use this CPU can also upgrade to 13th gen, and MAYBE even 14th gen.. all be it with BIOS updates. So if you need a ""hold over"" until you can go 13th or 14th gen. The 12400 / 12400f is an absolute terrific choice."

Excellent",12-07-2023,Easily the best CPU for the value as of 2023 (For Intel standards at least...).

Works great with an RTX 3060 graphics card.

Excellent for budget builds",06-10-2022,"I don't do a lot of heavy gaming so this works well for me. I've paired it with an RTX 2060 and haven't had issues running games. However, the stock CPU fan doesn't seem to fit into my motherboard well (it is an ASUS Prime B660M-A) and struggles to keep cool when playing more intensive games. I plan to replace it with a different cooler soon anyway, but it's something to keep in mind. I think if the fan plays nice with your motherboard it should do just fine. I would also recommend replacing the stock thermal paste if you do use the included fan."

Great cheap new gen cpu!",24-07-2022,This cpu is great! Runs fast has some great speeds and preforms as good as a 10th gen i9! But I have a few complaints.1. The stock cooler is not the best for max turbo and I get mid 70c to low 80c under load and idles around 60c2. The stock cooler is also VERY loud trying not to overheat the cpuBut It was very easy to fix this issue I got a 3rd party reseller for my stock cooler and everything was fine! 10/10 cpu

Horrible Efficiency",03-04-2024,"overall intel is great for a work station, HOWEVER the 14 series is stupid as hell... it offers NO benefit in 99.9% of situations over 13 series... I upgraded from a 12700k, and saw only minor improvements, and at the expense of power cost. My desktop now idles at 150-250 watts... before with my 12700k it was idling at like half that. in most cases a lot of people wont care, however being forced to live in a high cost of living state like CA, where electricity is $0.44 per kwh, that means just idling is costing me 0.11 per hour, that's $1000 a year just in idling... plus all the electricity my house uses. I'm only here temporarily (military) and will be moving as soon as retire, but its something to note.On top of that, its a straight refresh of the older 13th gen, and they blocked APO for the 13th and 12th gen and aren't working on getting it working across the board (only minor useless titles no one honestly cares about)...If it was a bit cheaper to go AMD, I would have went to a 7800x3d, but that would have cost me about 900 just to switch, due to having to buy new RAM (still on DDR4, 3600mhz/CL14) and Motherboard...There's also the constant issue of certain games/programs just refusing to run in Multithread/Multicore, or using the E-cores inappropriately. Intel really needs to sort out this trash..."

UPDATED: BSOD CPU: CLOCK_WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT",28-01-2024,"The media could not be loaded.
                



UPDATE: Been at this for days and days. Intel core i9-14900k on ASUS z790 Strix is a BSOD MACHINE. Previouslyit would run for many minutes. Now it barely goes one ir two minutes before freezing and a BSOD. Now I'm doing ASUS BIOS MemTest86 so far so good (for the RAM).While Windows 11 Pro was working I did the Memory Diagnostics and it said it passed. So either the CPU or the Motherboard is bad.New ASUS Z790 Strix, with new Intel i9-14900k, with new T700 2TB Gen5 PCIE 5 NVME M2, and new 64GB DDR5 6400 RAM, with Runs Windows 11 Pro. All drivers up and Windows are up to date.I've not done any overclocking or XMP in the bios to push the RAM 4000Mhz to the advertised 6400. I avoided buying RAM that can go 8000Mhz with XMP because there are so very many failures with those--and I wanted 8000 because I wanted a system with no bottlenecks as much as possible.Runs great for about 5 to 30 minutes. Temps run from 30s to 50s to high 80s bouncing up and down like normal. Then BOOM BSODs.I will do tests including memory, cpu, and double check drivers.Most websites point to a CPU issue. Some mention RAM or drivers.I'm either going to solve this issue or return this i9-14900 CPU and replace it with an i9-13900.I hope to remember this review and update it with success info."

BEWARE of the New LGA 1700 Socket",20-03-2024,"I've been a lifetime Intel diehard fan but man they really pushed a disappointing product out. This thing gets HOT, I've been building computers for a while but I've never seen a CPU regularly spike to 100 C with liquid cooling. My previous 8700k ran great and was fulling overclocked to 4.8GHz and I never saw anything higher than 78 C under 100% load. I was so sketched out by seeing the 14700k temps that I ran Intel's CPU diagnostic software and I couldn't even finish it! The temps got to a steady 93-100 C while testing so I had to cancel it and let the CPU cool down.I even tried some gaming with it and while playing Helldivers 2 at ""High/Medium"" settings It liked to hover at 95C and spiked constantly. This caused thermal throttling and game stutters followed with it. Even while at the desktop fully idle my temps would spike around from 25 C all the way up to 70 C. The reason for this is the new LGA 1700 socket ILM, you have to buy, replace, and correctly torque a WHOLE new socket brace just so you can kind of tame this CPU.I remember when Intel was known for keeping cool and AMD for getting hot. That's not the case anymore and I'm so disappointed because Intel was my go to with every single PC I ever built."

BUYER BEWARE",03-05-2024,I have written a couple of dozen reviews on Amazon and this is only my second negative review.  I placed an order for a brand new Intel 14700K CPU from Amazon and it arrived as an Open Box (the factory seal had been cut and the processor was jammed into the packaging at an odd angle.  I installed it in my system and it would not boot - did not even get past the POST testing.  I uninstalled it and send back for a refund with a note that it was an open box and was defective.I give this only a single star across all categories as the processor arrived in an open box (I paid full price for a new CPU) and did not work in my system (it was defective on arrival) - it's a month later and I still have not received a refund.  I purchased an identical CPU from another source and that CPU booted up with no issues (it is running the PC I am typing this review on) so clearly an issue with the quality of the product that Amazon shipped to me.

Series known to have issues",31-05-2024,"The 13th and 14th gen intel cpu chips are notorious for being unstable and low quality. While installation is easy, the chip may come with deficiencies that get worse over time.For the first couple months after install i would experience BSoD crashes and i was trying to diagnose. Now 2 months later the computer will no longer boot without BSoD. All other hardware has been replaced meaning the chip is absolutely the issue. Currently in the process of RMA negotiations with intel because diagnosis took longer than the amazon return window. So far their service has been slow to respond. Until intel admits to the faults in these generations and offers an actual fix i would suggest sticking to AMD. I wish i had.I personally never overclocked the card, never had the chance, it wasn't very stable on default settings. Had a ticket with intel since 3 days ago, they havent reaponded in 2 days. Buyer be ware..."

Would be a great CPU but mine defective but it still booted and acted fine at first.",02-06-2024,"System booted  fine with 2 ram sticks installed and it appeared that everything was fine at first but after some time issues started to show up.  Unfortunately this did not happen until the 30 day return policy elapsed.  At first I thought it was the motherboard or RAM.  But testing of different RAM ruled that out.  Bios updates to the motherboard did not help the issue.  Putting in a known good CPU allowed the final test of the motherboard and original system RAM and that all passed which indicates a issue with the CPU.  Now I'm waiting for Intel RMA process to have them test the CPU again and hopefully replace it.  When I did not have issues, it was a fast CPU, very impressed with that, just wish this showed up sooner."

The amount of problems this CPU has caused me has cost me hundreds of hours of work. I've been building computers for over 20 years and this is by far the absolute worst component of all time. E cores will cause instability in almost every multithreaded application, clocking has to be severely limited to avoid blue screen of death, Intel Extreme Tuning Utility is borderline malware, and the high thread count is just deceptive marketing because 1/3 of the cores are laptop grade. It gave the illusion of stability through the return period so I'm now stuck with a $500 paper weight CPU and motherboard."

i9 CPU Instability and Degradation - Buyer Beware",19-05-2024,"purchased the i9 CPU six months ago with high expectations for top-tier performance. Initially, it lived up to those expectations, running smoothly for about four months. However, my experience took a turn for the worse when instability issues began to plague my system.Games started crashing randomly to the desktop, and I encountered frustrating VRAM errors in Fortnite, which are known issues with 13th and 14th gen i9 CPUs. I soon realized that my motherboard's default settings were likely to blame, as they inadvertently cooked my CPU, causing it to degrade rapidly over a short period. Despite my efforts to disable overclocking features like ASUS Multicore Enhancement, the motherboard continued to apply overclocks, exacerbating the problem.In response to widespread complaints, Intel and motherboard manufacturers released BIOS updates touted to fix the issue by reducing power limits, known as the Intel Baseline Defaults profile. Initially, this seemed to restore stability to my system, but the respite was short-lived. After about a month, the same issues resurfaced, casting doubt on the effectiveness of the solution.I am currently dealing with Intel support over this CPU, and I have a case number with them as we work to resolve the ongoing issues. The fact that these issues are still ongoing and Intel is actively investigating the root cause speaks to the severity and complexity of the problem.Based on my experience and the prevalence of similar issues, I urge potential buyers to think carefully before investing in the i9 CPU. Considering the reported stability of i7 CPUs, it may be a safer choice for those prioritizing reliability."

Do NOT buy 14th Gen i9's",30-04-2024,"Hey all,I built my most recent rig with the following specs:CPU: i9-14900kMotherboard: MSI Carbon WiFi II Z-790RAM: 64 gig rip jaw low profile (certified compliant by MSI)Cooler: Dark Rock Pro 5GPU: ROG 4070Ti SuperPower Supply: Rog Thor 850w PlatinumCase: Corsair 4000DThis rig should be a monster, but because Intel has misled the general public, it is completely unstable and blue screens multiple times per day. These 14th-generation chips are trash. They are fraught with instability issues, and the news worsens as time progresses. We have been through three motherboards, three different sets of RAM, and two different GPUs, and the problems continue.Now, I have to decide if I can be without my rig for several weeks to try to RMA the chip via Intel. The worst part of all this is a crap shoot if I receive an actual working chip back. Again, it does not appear to be the chip itself but the instruction/algorithm Intel uses.Motherboard manufacturers are allowing these chips, by default, to run off the rails. Intel's power spec is 253W. When I checked the BIOS on my motherboard(s), they come by default set to run at just under 5000W! Are you kidding me? If you are not a really good problem solver with these things. I do not see the average consumer having any understanding of why their rig is acting like a crazy person.Anyway, just do yourselves a favor and take a big ol' pass on these chips. They are not worth it. Stick with your old chips until the next gen comes out or just switch over to AMD.@Intel; you have to stop being the Boeing of the Chip world. You were once a great company with high standards, and now you are just imping for your shareholders. Get it together, and start doing things right.

Possibly better memory support than i9-13900K",05-04-2024,"Once they came down in price, I did get a i9-14900K as an ""upgrade"" from a i9-13900KF to  i9-14900K .  It's OK but I can't rave over it.  It is more of an sideways change rather than an upgrade.The i9-14900K is fast but not more so that a i9-13900K.  For me, the Cinebench R23 scores are about the same for 13th versus 14th gen.  Though the i9-14900K appears to run DDR5 more stably and at higher frequencies than the i9-13900K.  Also, the i9-14900K is enabled for XTU AI enable tuning in XTU but it's not that helpful.  I even wonder if it is worth getting a K at all, these CPU's are plenty fast for gaming without overclocking.I did NOT notice a significant improvement in the operating temperatures.  Maybe a slight improvement but I did flush out the cooling system and clean out the water block so I am doubtful that the running temps are better.  Also, I suggest that you NOT let these chips get anywhere near TjMax (100C).  I had one i9-13900KF literally fail due to allowing it to get to TjMax frequently when stress testing.  A second one became slightly flaky.I thought the built in ARC display support of the K version might be helpful since I intended to devote the graphics card to the gaming monitor and use the built-in ARC on a side display.  But as it turns out, it wasn't worth it for me.  If you are gaming with this level of processor, you really need a comparable graphics card but most of them will drive four displays.  IMO, you are better off getting a KF and spending the money so saved on better graphics card.The original asking price was insane, I bought it on a whim on a late night.  On the morning morning after, I had buyers remorse, tried to cancel but could not, so instead, I refused the package.  It took literally 6 months to get a refund.  That was rather irksome."

I finally lost",17-02-2024,"I've built computers for more than 20 years, and I have never in my life had so much trouble booting with stock bios settings. I think I finally lost the silicon lottery. Using an Asus mb, I had to go into bios limit voltage and manually tune each pcore. Temps were wild and out of control 100Â°c, clock speeds were low thermal throttling, random crashes, blue screens inability to run simple programs without them crashing and shutting down. Tried intel xtu auto overclocking, ai suite, and asus ai overclocking via bios.. none of that worked. Had to just dig into bios, set limits, and manually tune each core. Now system is stable and solid. Been benchmarking and stress testing for a few days now. Temps are great, and I am happy. Not sure if mb is culprit, gonna get another board and test the chip. Just be ready for some trouble. Looked over many forums of others having the same issues."

About a month or two in to owning it they released an Intel Management Engine update for this processor and that was it no more overclocks.

Thermal throttle spikes not present with 13900k",03-01-2024,"My 13900k never thermal throttled in any game, yet I'm getting thermal throttle spikes when playing games like Cyberpunk with the 14900k. My 360 AIO mount is not the issue, as temps hover around 90-93c when stress testing at 253w. I'm also using a contact frame. I'm thinking the issue might be the increased voltage at the stock 5.7 all core frequencies, because my power usage has increased a lot while gaming. Whatever the case, I'm not the only one seeing this behavior - it's unacceptable.Update: Reducing the e-cores to 4.3 helps significantly, and setting everything to 5.5/4.3 (13900k values) solves it completely. Simply too much voltage is being pumped into the chip at stock frequencies. I've set up a Thermal Velocity Boost profile where 80c drops to 5.6, and 90c drops to 5.5, with e-cores at 4.3... and the issues are basically gone. Ridiculous that this has to be done though."

Insane performance at a cost",02-06-2024,"This processor is a speed demon. Gaming, editing, encoding, and whatever else you can think of, it can handle. The performance is there. The value for money is quite good too. Unless you really want top of the line, this chip effectively eliminates the i9 from consideration. 20 cores. 8P and 12E. Boost up to 5.6GHz on 2 threads. I swapped a 12600K for this part and I'm still kinda staggered at just how fast it is in heavily threaded apps. This is a perfect upgrade chip for somebody on an older 12th gen i5 or lower. I wouldn't consider building new with it however.There's a cost to this CPU though. Heat. And power draw. I have an Arctic Liquid Freezer III 360 AIO on this chip, and even with a sizable undervolt, it still throttles at around 230W running 100C. It feels like this chip is almost uncoolable. Unless you go full custom liquid cooling or something. I considered a large air cooler for this chip and I'm glad I went with an AIO. Buyer beware. This thing runs hot. It's also incredibly fast. If you can cool it this thing will fly."

Main improvement is lower power cost day-day",03-05-2024,"I upgraded from an 8700k to this 14700k nearly 8 years later. Performance-wise, the difference is fairly negligible to me, and that is reflected in the 'real' specs. Going from 6 cores to 20 cores isnt really a 3x+ increase when most of those cores are 'efficiency cores'. User benchmark puts 14700k as only being 47% faster than the 8700k, despite being 8 years and 6 generations apart.The main improvement from my point of view is the reduced idle/casual power use. My UPS tells me that for my 8700k/1070ti system I drew ~0.43 Kw, and my new 14700k/4070ti super draws ~0.31 Kw watching YT, browsing the web (includes fans, monitors, etc).Mostly just wanted more balance for the new graphics card, since that's what does most of the heavy lifting these days anyway.

Fast, but unstable when overclocked.",11-01-2024,"I built 3 systems using 14900 series. They all had serious stability problems when in use.  After researching for weeks and reinstalling OS with no better result.  I finally disabled overclocking ""AI overclocking"", which was running as high as 1.6v.  I also found a BIOS setting after running some tools and set it INTEL FAIL SAFE.  this allowed me to run the AVX2 stress test successfully.  It basically throttles the chip.I can't tell you the frustration this caused figuring this out.  Everything from chrome browsers to Adobe CS would crash randomly for no apparent reason every few minutes while all ""tests"" showed it was fine.  I lowered my refresh rate to 60 from 120, killed AI overclocking and set the INTEL setting and now have a very stable system. It outperforms my 5950x when encoding, which is impressive.  It does run HOT even with water cooling.  IF I had it to do over again, I would avoid 13000 and 14000 chips as there is a OODLE issue as well when it comes to gaming with Unreal 5.  Basically an unfixable hardware flaw that affects some chips.Here's the thing, you will not notice a difference as nothing I use with the exception of HANDBRAKE, ever comes close to maxing out the chip when in use.  Adobe CS uses my 3080ti and the intel quicksync iGPU simultaneously which rarely went above 40%, and usually was around 15-20 when editing.  HW encodes for HD were at 350fps, software, 250, intel 300.  So a small advantage in Adobe CS is why I went with the 14900K vs KF.System was using ""AI overclocking"" pushing it to 6.2 roughly single core.  Disabled in BIOS now.Specs: Asus z290a Wifi II, Corsair 96GB DDR5 5600, Samsung 990 Pro, CPU Water cooled, 3080tiSo the ""K"" is basically useless for me at this point and don't see myself doing it manually as it's just not worth it to me.  That said, when stable, it's a very capable chip."

Please note that the F in the 14700KF means NO iGPU",24-02-2024,"Wanted to purchase the unlocked version of the 20 core 14th gen processor and saw that this was a cheaper option at the time. All the description says is that ""Discrete graphics is required."" It would be much more helpful by adding a line that says the F version stands for no integrated graphics card. If you're doing any kind of workstation work such as video editing, most software will take advantage of the processor having an iGPU as well and so I'm actually losing performance with this model version. I'll have to return the item to purchase the correct version without an F. I would give it a full 5 stars if it had the line explaining the F version."

A Monster CPU with One Major Caveat",20-10-2023,"I built PC with the new Intel i9-14900k, and I must say, it's a beast of a processor. Coming from an i7-8700k, the performance boost is nothing short of incredible. Multitasking, gaming, and content creation have all seen a significant improvement. Multithreaded applications and gaming experiences run smoother.  It's a productivity powerhouse. The clock speeds are no slouch either, making it excellent for single-threaded tasks and gaming. The major downside of this CPU is the heat it generates. Even with a high-end cooling solution, it tends to run hot, and that's something you must take into consideration when setting up your cooling solution. Be ready for this CPU to draw a significant amount of power at full load. It can put quite a load on your power supply and might necessitate an upgrade if you're not already prepared. The Intel i9-14900k is an incredible processor, and the upgrade from an i7-8700k is substantial. Its exceptional performance in various tasks justifies its price tag. If you're willing to address these challenges, you'll be rewarded with a fantastic computing experience."

Intel has a long way to go.",21-10-2023,"To start, this is a great CPU. I consistently maintain 5.4-5.6 GHz without entering overclocking territory. I paired it with an MSI Suprim X 4070ti, and they destroy 1440p together. However, this is obviously a refresh and NOT a new generation. Performance gains are limited and to get there they raised TDP and thus it runs HOT. I have a 240mm AIO and its.. fine. It's just disappointing that this is how Intel responds to competition. This is a missed opportunity. A very good CPU but with both GPU and AMD CPU's getting leaps in generational performance this was disappointing."

Cool stock, hot with unlocked TDP limits",31-10-2023,"I love and hate this CPU. Out of the box with stock intel specs it runs cool on a 360mm AIO but really hardly any gains over a 13900k. This is not a new generation so intel should have done what they have done in the past and call this a 13990k or even 13970k like they did back in the Devils Canyon release (4790k upgraded from 4770k)on a 13900k if you unlock the TDP limits through features like Asus Multicore Enhancement (or manually remove the TDP limits) it basically performs within margin of error of the 14900k stock limits if not beats it on longer test when Intel limits are reached (10min loop of Cinebench R23 for example).If you unlock the limits of the 14900k you start getting thermal throttling with high core count benchmarks and then it actually can perform worse than the 13900k with unlocked limits because the 13900k will hold 5.5ghz but the 14900k will bounce between 5.2-5.6ghz.I had to set the power use limits to 320w in the BIOS to get it to reliably match or sometimes beat the 13900k with unlocked TDP limits.Where this CPU can shine is if you are into undervolting. I suspect there is some headroom there.If you are air cooling the CPU or even a 240mm AIO you probably need to keep this on the stock intel TDP limits and would be fine.To really get the most out of the 14900k I would say you need a custom loop, otherwise just get a 13900k and unlock the TDP limits with a 360mm AIO cooler. Still 4 stars because it is basically a 13900k. I would give the 13900k 5 stars.If the 14900k was much more expensive I would probably downgrade it to a 3 star CPU. They basically are asking for what the 13900k cost so it seems like a fair tradeoff."

6.2GHZ 8200mts cl38 Daily Driver.",04-04-2024,"This professional CPU isn't designed for the average user. However, if you're a tinkerer at heart, eager to dive deeper than the surface-level information often presented in YouTube ""videos"" (or should we say, commercials), this is unquestionably for you. I've acquired multiple units for various builds/configurations from a wide array of retailersâBest Buy, Newegg, and others included.For those considering making a purchase, I highly recommend using an Apex/Apex Encore MOBO or another reputable 2 DIMM board, particularly for AM5 or LGA1700, if overclocking is your goal. A high-quality cooler is crucial; for those opting for an AIO, ensure it includes at least an 8th gen Asetek pump and a 360 Thickboy copper radiator with performance fansâAvoid the aesthetically pleasing but functionally inferior Lian Li reversed SL Infinity Fans. Genuine static pressure fans, capable of efficiently doing the job, are what you need. Despite what your favorite YouTuber might suggest, you should prioritize efficiency over aesthetics.When selecting DDR5, opt for GOOD BINNED options. If a high-binned QVL compatible set isn't your choice, at a minimum, go for HYNIX A for single rank and HYNIX M for dual rank.The 14900K, when expertly tuned, becomes a gaming and multitasking powerhouseâachieving 43 to 44k in R23, with 6.2GHz boosting, 5.9GHz across its 8 physical cores and 8 threads, and 16 physical e-cores at 4.7GHz for a total of 32 threads, of which only 8 are virtual. With hyper-threading and e-cores enabled, it supports 8200 to 8400 MTS CL38 DDR5 RAM, boasts sub-55ns bus latency, and sub-9.3ns FWL. It's a marvel in Aida64 full, minus SSD, burn-in stress test stability. Adjusting all cores down to 5.8 and boosting to 6.0 can further reduce bus latency to easily below 50ns...Did I mention overall CPU temperatures typically remain between 35 to 40Â°C under heavy gaming loads, rarely exceeding 50Â°C? Despite the capability of 3 EATX connections to easily deliver over 400W of power, I'd advise against exceeding 325W daily, as the performance gains beyond this point are minimal without extreme overclocking and cooling methodsâincreased voltage requirements could significantly shorten the lifespan of your CPU. For tinkerers, this CPU is a dream come true.As of this dateâ4-4-2024: We anticipate future silicon manufacturing constraints will evolve, but that's a discussion for another time.The X3D Elephant in the room: Don't worry, I own one, and this is about science, not purchase bias...We'll sidestep intricate discussions about CLDO, FCLK, and MCLK concerns, and why the substantial L3 cache has become an essential workaround for the instability caused by chiplet-based IMC in handling DDR5 for gamers. If the augmentation of the L3 cache wasn't primarily to address DDR5 issues stemming from the chiplet design, why not significantly enhance and accelerate the L1 cache? The design doesn't allow for it since it's not monolithic, which wouldn't be practical. Those well-versed in the subject matter understand this. While chiplets represent the future, we must acknowledge that this future hasn't fully materialized for every aspect of computing, allowing us to look beyond the ""normie YouTuber AMD cults.""Indeed, I own a 7800X3D build and absolutely adore it! It excels in gaming... primarily in GAMING! Thus, there's no cause for concern. Let's briefly touch on the ""benefits"" like reduced thermals and supposed platform longevity (as if motherboard chipset upgrades and advancements in power delivery methods don't occur... humor me, over the planned 6 years). I, too, long for Z390 features on my Z790 board (/end sarcasm), not to mention the potential for longer boot times when tinkering with DDR5 or PBO, or even under normal conditions, and texture stutter/tearing... oops, and all those other delightful topics Lisa tends to highlight without addressing the influence of influencers with communications degrees rather than computer science degrees.  Just having fun, do what you love!I don't blame Amazon, Intel, AMD, or Nvidia more than the other. Manufacturing and shipping issues happen. The chip I received from Amazon didn't meet my expectations, but my other purchases have been exceptional. By chance alone, the other four 14900Ks I've received from various distributors have been stellar!Note:Settings in pictures are daily driven....No stability concerns all AIDIA 64 Stress tested for multiple hours and hundreds of gaming/workload hours.  I can get bus latency down to under 50NS but need to decrease core clock to locked 5.8GHZ to stay at safe voltage....

IF YOU WANT THE AIR COOLED OPTION",11-02-2024,"I'm not going to go over the same performance reviews others have done, yes its very fast for only $550 its the king of the poor mans build PC. my last PC its replacing was a $1000 10980xe and looking at the numbers the 14900k in average is 70-77% faster than the 10980xe. the only disadvantage between the 2 was the 10980xe had 48 PCIe lanes and ran 32c to 56c hot.i can't say the same about the 14900k heat, its spreader is almost half of the 10980xe. you can't just simply add a stock cooler or a ""MC'watercooler"" and expect the problem will solve itself. this is the first CPU in my 26 yrs of building PC's you have to plan out your cooler set up.ever since a 2012 water leak from these Mc'watercoolers (all in one 2 fan radiator kits sold by name brands) Ive never trusted them cost me $1500 in damages. The only water coolers that don't leak for me were the ones i built but water cooling is expensive and you have to inspect them at least every 3 months for debris in the tank or leaks. with air i only have to clean the pc 2x a year.yes you can control temps with an air cooler, and get the same temps as a 3 fan radiator water cooler. I'll post the results without adding a watt limit in the mobo post screen.here is the parts i bought to air cool running the new cinabench 2024 for 30 mins i can get max performance on a defualt non OC not hitting above 99C on the P cores1. Noctua NH-D15 chromax.Black | Dual-Tower CPU Cooler | 140mm | Black2. Noctua NF-A15 HS-PWM chromax.Black.swap (this adds a 3rd fan for the air cooler you'll need it)3.

Easycargo 40mm Heatsink Kit 40mmx40mmx20mm (this you place on the flat base of the noctua cooler will help dissipate heat)5. Easycargo 100pcs Heatsink Assortment Kit Small Cooler Aluminum Heat (these you throw on the back of your mobo on and around the mount brackets you'll me amazed how adding heat sinks on the back of the mobo will reduce temps)6. Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut (this is the best thermal grease cooler by 1-2c cooler than artic silver mx 6)7. Thermalright Intel 12th/13th Generation LGA1700 Anti-Bending Buckle ( a must add a little thermal grease on the cpu side flaps this buckle is 100% aluminum will al help dissipate heat.then i went to my mother board software options (mobo is an MSI MEG Z790 ACE MAX) select ""CPU cooler tuning"" select ""tower air cooling"" which will limit the wattage draw to under 300w also note if you are not using a Water Cooling Reservoir  you should also use this option, water cooling a 14900k and OC really does require a reservoir, and a 4x 120 fan size radiator if you're simply using a pre-built 2x fan radiator its not enough to handle the 14900k and the CPU is known for drawing 370w plus!!so using air cooled i got a 2371 score with no watt limiter option an temps were 78-100c on the p cores, and with the 300 watt limit the score was  2328 with temps 70-99c never hit 100c case the limiter would kick in. (note this is from CPU testing that punishes the CPU realistically i don't see this CPU going over 88c even on the most demanding game in 3 years.i personally do not recommend OC this CPU its already been pushed to its limits by INTEL at best for another 100 watts when all you're getting is 3-4 more FPS and that's not worth it. and all these people bragging a 6.2-6.5ghz OC, there just flexing for clout, then they take the CPU back to default. i already have my P cores spiking to 6.002 at 288-300 watts, and under 99c temps; adding 0.198mhz will meaning nothing for apps and gaming.personal note the MSI MEG Z790 ACE MAX Gaming Motherboard is absolutely amazing at squeezing out all the performance of the 14900k worth the $700 price never crashed during testing that 26 power phases is godly  compared to my last gen EVGA x299 dark had 12 phase...RIP EGA :("

i7-14700K is a significant improvement from i9-12900K",31-05-2024,"I decided the difference between the i7 and the i9 didn't justify the price difference, considering I was already getting about 1/3 more performance than my 12th generation i9. I wanted plenty of motherboard resources so I also bought the MSI MEG Z790 ACE, 32 GB of Kingston Fury 6400MT/s DDR5 and a 2TB Samsung 990 NVMe drive.Cooling had been a slight issue with the 12th generation i9, even with a 360mm AIO cooler, so I went custom loop. Along the way I found a GPU water cooler on sale and decided to install a lot of cooling. The Thermaltake 900 tower can take two 560mm radiators, but I wanted some disks, so I went for a 560x140 and a 280x140, both 45mm thick and backed by 6 fans. Four more fans feed air into the case and there's till plenty of clear space for more air to be dragged in.So what's the result? The processor runs at 85C worst case, and only two cores at that temperature. The fast DDR5 does make a significant difference. I initially ran it at 6GT/s then turned it up to 6.2 and finally 6.4. The last change is a 3.5% change in DDR5 speed and that gave me a 2.4% increase in system speed. I kept my old RTX3070 which used to run over 80C and now runs at 62C worst case. So despite more performance the system runs a lot cooler.I mostly run X-Plane 12, which runs the GPU and CPU very hard, continuously. After several hours the cooling water reached 36C and the worst core temperature was 85C. The processor just works. No stability issues with the standard settings on the MSI Z690 motherboard. There are three standard memory tuning options for 6.0, 6.2, and 6.4 GT/s and all work. This will do for me for a few years."

I MADE IT WORK",22-05-2024,This is something that a lot of people do not understand about processors. If you put too much voltage you are going to damage it. I want to delid it but I don't see the need and here is whyEven if I can get it 20 degrees cooler it will not matter It will still need 3.5 to 4.2 volts to stay stable at advertised speeds.I am running it @ 5.4 GHZ all P cores and this thing is unbelievably reliable . And maybe 10 seconds extra to render vs 5.7 to 6.0 GHZI get the point that ppl want to have the Bragging rights to say that it runs that fast but it will gwt damaged guaranteed 400 watts is a lot for that little unit. I think that 5.4 5.3 5.2 is more than enough specially when you have a total of 32 threads and gaming is practically single threaded . And most games are GPU bound. I only use it in the gaming department for Flight simulator and have not seen it above 68 degrees.I had a 4770 k and still running strong at 4.5 GHZ in a very small case.Intel is a beast and this I 9 is very good . Future proof for at least 5 years to come .Note. I have delided at least 20 cpus and the ones that got damaged were the ones that got a lot of voltage . They are very heat resistant but voltage just kills them .I have been running this cpu 24 /7 not an issueNot a blue screenJust underclock and undervolt and you are good to go This thing is a monster .

Much faster than my previous i7-6850k",19-03-2024,"So I finally upgraded my home workstation, and went to this new i9-14900K. It is incredibly fast. I had a Davinci Resolve video project file that I rendered on my old setup, the i7-6850K and it took just over 22 minutes to complete the render. On the new i9, the exact same file was re exported, took just over 8 minutes..! almost a 3x speed increase.! Also, when you speed up footage in Resolve, the old cpu could not play it back smoothly, it would jump and chug like crazy, the new i9, it plays it back sped up 800% no problems and I can actually see how it looks without having to export the entire video clip to see it playback the retimed footage smoothly. Applications open u p much faster too, but that could be more due to the pcie4.0 nvme system drive that is much faster than the previous version nvme I had in the old build. The one thing I do not like about the new cpu, is the number of pci lanes. You only get 20, 16 are pcie5.0 and 4 are pcie4.0. This wont be an issue for most people, but my old cpu had 40 lanes, allowing me to run 3 GPU's at the same time, and YES, I needed them, I use GPU rendering software that can use up to 8 GPU's in one system on one license and every additional GPU speeds up your render times a lot when rendering out 3D sims. With this new cpu, I can only run 2 GPU's and they run at 8x, cause they share the 16x, and that does leave me 4 full pcie4.0 lanes for the system drive. It is not a deal breaker, and the increased speed overall is well worth it. One thing EVERYBODY should be aware of, is these new intel chips have P cores and E cores. Something my old cpu did NOT have. E-cores can severely impact certain software performance. When I booted up the new machine and tried my Ableton DAW  for the first time, I was expecting to be so happy with a performance boost, and the software was literally almost unusable.! The E-cores were slowing the software down so bad, I could barely change settings in the preferences.! It was that bad. I had to install process lasso ( fantastic software that is free if you have never heard of it ) and disable the use of E-cores for Ableton and then it worked very fast and is great.!"

I haven't had any crashes or stability issues at all. I did a full platform upgrade from the 10900k to this, I kept my RTX 3080 and the performance bump was actually fully noticeable.

After switching back to auto clock, I still managed the same temps, but getting 5.1-5.2Ghz on Pcore and 4.3 on Ecore. If my case allowed 120mm fans, I would of most definitely installed 240mm AIO cooler. That for sure would of helped with the temps and get me higher benchmark numbers.When it came to rendering a 20 minute 4k video on sony Vegas Pro 18 (IGPU only), it took about 15 minutes to complete it vs my I9 9900k that would of taken over an hour to finish it (RTX 3060). This system was meant specifically VR/light video editing. So, considering how fast it is on the rendering without a dedicated GPU, I am pretty excited about it.

Running air cooled on DeepCool Assassin IV with ease",03-11-2023,"So far so good.  This CPU is a monster and runs very nicely and boosts to max clocks (6ghz on two cores and 5.7ghz on all cores) unlimited TDP settings but thermally limited at 90c with -60mV offset.  I have noticed that it runs a bit cooler than my previous 13900KF, especially when you consider the core to core deltas.  I use my PC mostly for gaming and encoding, so as long as you have a great case with plenty of air flow and a top notch cooler, you can easily run it air cooled without issues as it will just throttle itself when it hits whatever thermal maximum you set in the UEFI BIOS.In gaming workloads it never throttles though and stays at 5.7ghz all core boost the entire time with temps in CPU intensive games anywhere from the upper 50s to mid 60s and upper 40s to mid 50s in non CPU intensive games**Update**I have the CPU now at 5.8ghz with HT disabled and a -75mV offset and it's working like a charm and very stable in gaming workloads and encoding (it downclocks when it hits 90c for encoding workloads but for gaming it stays at 5.8ghz), which is amazing since it's on an air cooled setup, though the setup is as optimal as it gets for air cooling!  As for temps, they are a little lower than running it at 5.7ghz with HT enabled and a -50mV offset.  If I use a -75mV offset with 5.8ghz and HT enabled, my PC crashes.  So disabling HT definitely enables the CPU to use less power.If you're predominantly using your machine for gaming, then I definitely recommend turning HT off regardless as most games tend to run better with HT disabled.  But if you're using it for productivity or a blend of both productivity and gaming, then definitely turn HT on.The only mildly disappointing thing for me is that the memory controller isn't as good as I thought it would be.  Mine runs 48GB DDR5 7400 CL34 at 1.35V on the IMC, but to hit DDR5 7600 CL36 with stability I need to increase the IMC voltage to 1.41V which just isn't worth it if you ask me for such a minor bump in performance.  My previous 13900KF could do 48GB DDR5 7800 at 1.36V on the IMC.Core wise though, the CPU is definitely superior to 13th gen."

Great Performance",14-11-2023,Built a new system with the 14700k for photo/video editing and some gaming. Decided to go with the 14th gen i7 instead of the 13th gen since it's the only series that had a noticeable improvement (4 more e cores and threads). Very fast for video editing and overkill for most gaming. Absolutely love it!

It does get spicy when I'm rendering or doing some crazy multi tasking.Gaming seems fine, no issues.  I play all kinds of games, FPS, MMO's, survival, etc.  (Paired with a Gigabyte Gaming 4090 OC, Tforce 64 gigs 6000 M/T DDR5, samsung 990 pro NVME 2 tb x2, no OCing done by me.)I replaced a 5950x, which was having issues for some reason, just felt like it was getting slower and slower, thermal paste and heat were fine on it, never got over 60c with the beefier AIO I had on it.  Just took longer and longer to render things.  I guess I wore it out!I just think you'll want a good AIO, and/or a solid water cooling solution for this to really get the best out of it.  I'm not sure a air cooled option will do you any good, but hey I've been wrong many times, so there might be something that can handle the job.All in all, not bad, but it's not going to give you much performance boost over last gen, matter of fact I found out later 13700k beats it in a lot of tests, blargh!  Either way, its fast, and it runs everything great, so I'm happy till the next go around."

So far so good.",22-10-2023,"Sorta came from a 13900k but I gave that to a relative after their x299/i9-7940x system began to have issues. He bought a z790 board and was amazed how far ahead the 13900k is in comparison an overclocked Skylake-X processor. He fixed the issue with the x299 system, but he decided to stay with Raptor Lake. All of which is okay by me because that old 13900k had no overclocking headroom, and I could only undervolt it by 5mv before it became unstable. I was going to buy another 13900k or maybe the ks version, but I decided to wait for the 14900k.The 14900k I got on the other hand has some overclocking headroom. I already set all P-cores to 5.8GHz, while keeping the double-core Turbo Boost at 6.0GHz. I also set the cache to 5.2Ghz and it's completely stable. I was not able to raise the multiplier at all with my 13900k. Just happy my 14900k isn't a lottery loser.While the clock of both the 13900ks and 14900k are the same, the 13900ks has a cherry picked memory controller. If you're looking to do a ton of RAM overclocking then the 13900ks may be the way to go.... but that's not to say if you'd get a 14900k with a good memory controller. Both my 13900k and 14900k work with DDR5-7200 RAM with XMP set, and no adjustments to the memory controller voltages.If you're buying the 14900k off the get-go and building a new system around it, then I recommend pairing it with a motherboard that has the BIOS Flashback feature."

Very good and reliable processor",31-12-2023,"Very good processor, upgraded form a very nice Ryzen 1700 (6 years old with me) to this one, decided to go intel due to memory stability. After 3 weeks I can say I love it, very nice temps while gaming and I've received around a 60% improvement in my games (I maintained my RTX3070). I'm currently using a NZXT Kraken Elite 360 AIO to cool it and it has been showing around 50-60 C during high intensive gaming which is very good. Went with this over the 7800X3D since I feel this is more future proof for productivity since I upgrade every 5-6 years.

This one replaced my i7 8700k and it is noticeably faster for my daily work (mostly Office, Internet content) and gaming (COD MW3). In terms of power consumption and heat generation, I can hardly notice it since all the workload I put on it hardly heats it up more than 45C-50C.

High TDP and Temperatures",02-12-2023,"A very powerful processor, but if it does not have good cooling, its functions will be limited. Currently it is working wonders together with the other components. But if they have a moderate cooling system, it is advisable to use the other brand of processors ""AMD"" that has half the temperatures, but with 10% to 20% less performance in some activities, and with the defects that come with not have an architecture that self-protects well or do not update its software often for better handling.Finally, I recommend the processor, only if you have a processor that does not meet current needs. My I7 6700k can do it all, but for some specific technologies, such as SSD Gen 4, peripherals with high-speed USB - C and others, it couldn't cope."

Let me tell you, this processor is the absolute best! With its 12 cores, it brings a whole new level of performance to my gaming experience. Whether I'm playing graphically demanding AAA titles or indulging in intense multitasking, this processor effortlessly handles it all. And what's even better is that it comes with integrated graphics, meaning I didn't have to shell out extra cash for a separate graphics card, yet. The integrated Graphics offer the flexibility of running dual displays smoothly without any hiccups. Plus, with Intel's reputation for reliable and high-quality products, I know I can trust the i7-12700K to last me for years to come.I hope you find this review helpful."

As for Boxed processor, they are sold by certain compagny and cost usually more. Fortunatly, the one i got was a boxed one, but still Intel told me i had a ''tray'' processor. i had to go on their website and enter my product information and send them the proof that their website is saying i have a ''box'' processor.

The only real downside of the 13600k is that it generally requires a 13th gen compatible motherboard, otherwise you'll need to FLASH THE BIOS on a 12th gen compatible motherboard to update the motherboard for it to be able to read 13th gen CPU (I highly do not recommend doing this). I've tried it a few and it's such a big hassle (many potential issues...)that I recommend first time PC builders or part buyers to just save yourself a headache and buy a 13th gen CPU, along with a 13th gen compatible motherboard (don't buy 12th gen mobo) which obviously doesn't require flashing bios for the 13600k to be usable."

A superb piece of a processor",,"No doubt, 12th gen Intel processors are a marvel of computing technology. Although there is a continuing tug of war between Intel and AMD in this regard. I personally chose Intel Core i7 (12700K) with inbuilt UHD graphics for my newly built desktop PC. For those, who don't want to use a separate and usually exorbitantly priced graphics cards, this processor is a very good alternative. It can handle most of the processing intensive rendering of Blender easily with its unlocked overclocking (obviously you have to use the supporting motherboard, i.e. presently available Z690 chipset motherboards). It can also smoothly handle almost all the tasks of Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop with no hiccups. Not to mention the support of 4K video with HDR if you are looking for some decent and the latest entertainment in your PC. I would suggest this 12th Gen i7 to those who want to use their PC for content creation purpose in the best possible way and also at the same time save some money (compared to 12th Gen i9, which would ideally be the best anyway, but costlier too). The price is still at a high level. Hopefully this comes down soon with the launch of Intel's 13th Gen processors!"

Intel is killing the game as of now.,,"I upgraded to this CPU after some HEAVY research, asking Reddit (Both Intel and AMD subreddits), weighing in money VS performance gained. I have used AMD since I was a teen and started building computers. The conclusion is this: It is an amazing CPU, runs faster and cooler than my Ryzen 7 1700. The price AND performance VS AMD (Also including a board) was better than if I had went with a Ryzen 7 5800X.Some background information: I wanted to upgrade after receiving an Amazon gift card (I have never ordered computer parts from Amazon though). I upgraded from a Ryzen 7 1700, with an ASUS x370-f board. I really wanted to upgrade, and was sad also that Windows 11 did not support my CPU! I will give it to Microsoft for this, as it made A LOT of people upgrade their entire computers, all for basically the same OS as of now with newer looks, and not much done under the hood (EXCEPT for 12th gen Intel, so good news there too). Sadly, my old board STILL doesn't support the Ryzen 7 5000 series, and only the 3000 series (They are working on a BIOS apparently for the 5000 series, because of people who were in my shoes). I first almost ordered the Ryzen 7 3800XT, for $400! After a couple hours of research, asking, and thinking about it... I cancelled that order (Thankfully) and thought ""Well, if I am going to spend this much on upgrading my CPU, I might as well go all in/spend a little more for something better, as this may be my last big upgrade in this regard for awhile."" I was then going to get the Ryzen 7 5800X with an Asus board. There lied a problem of price, I could not find a board AND get that CPU still within my budget (At-least not a board that wasn't worse than the one I had in ways). I mentioned I had posted on the AMD subreddit, and even they suggested I go Intel (Intel is just killing it as of now, hands down, although I am sure AMD will retaliate). I ended up getting the MSI Z690-A DDR4 (I wish I had the money for DDR5 RAM, I would have went with the DDR5 version as it was basically the same price). I had A LOT of second thoughts on this board though, as it just didn't seem ""Premium"" as the one I had (I am going to do a whole review on it after this. I'll save my Pros & Cons for there.) This CPU also auto-clocks itself up or down depending on the load (Saw it clock down to 1GHz, although not for long, for example if not much processing power is warranted, which makes sense and I wish everything did). So if idling, it will clock down and save power/heat/and therefore longevity is increased. I absolutely love this CPU coming from AMD. Anyways...If you have a Corsair H100I RGB Platinum or similar cooler already: The included 1200 screws work just fine with the 1700 socket and this CPU, even though you are supposed to get the 1700 kit/screws for this CPU (Which I did, but they are taking FOREVER to ship, so I googled, and someone said using the 1200 screws will work just fine). I get better temps. than my Ryzen 7 1700. I can even overclock EVEN MORE but have no need, and no point.TL:DRUpgraded from: Ryzen 7 1700, Asus Rog Strix x370-f gaming.Upgraded to: i7-12700K, MSI Z690-A DDR4.Parts kept: 4x8GB 32GB DDR4 CL16 3000MHz RAM (With XMP, D.O.C.P), RTX 2070. The RAM works great with this CPU as well, although it TECHNICALLY (Latency wise, runs at 2T on Intel instead of 1T on AMD) runs slower than when on AMD (AMD's infinity fabric) but obviously whatever Intel is doing makes up for that, and therefore my RAM either runs faster/the same)Pros: It is an amazing CPU for price VS performance. The i5-12600K is good as well (I almost just went with it), and you would be fine going with it for gaming (As even it still has more cores technically than the Ryzen 7 5800X, it also beats the 5800X even though THIS CPU is supposed to be its comparison rival brother.) This CPU has cool temps on my Corsair H100I RGB Platinum cooler, and the P&E core structure are REALLY cool and fun to watch when doing tasks/gaming. It shipped fast!Cons: Literally none with the CPU itself. Just with shipping - It shipped really fast! Was here in 2-3 days after purchasing on here. The biggest complaint I have is Amazon's shipping (SO BE AWARE OF THIS) I have never ordered computer parts from Amazon, and have always used New-egg. They just left the CPU in my mail-box, and if it weren't for me looking at my camera's, and looking out for this part, it would have sat in the mail-box all day. My mail-box sadly is not very weather proof as well, and if it had been raining... It wouldn't have been good. Although it did come in a big box around it. The CPU also was jarred loose and flopping around in the box (Not held into the front window).I hope this review helps people!"

I overclocked this via the motherboard/bios settings and it stays cool with a $30 fan cooler. (don't get a super cheap or small cpu cooler otherwise would risk overheating) Just follow installation instructions carefully the chip is delicate. windows experience rating is a 9.7 so that says it all.

AMD is doing fairly well as of late but Intel has a solid performance lead with it's single core performance on newer generation chips.If you're on the fence and want a quick top 5 for overall gaming performance, it goes as follows:1. i9-13900k2. i7-13700k3. i9-12900k4. i5-13600k5. i7-12700kThis chip is no slouch though, it trades blows with the 13600K in some situations if overclocked but overclocking isn't really fair for comparison.In conclusion, if you're looking around this price point, check both this CPU and the 13600k. Pick whichever is cheaper. Higher end 12th gen Intel motherboards can be flashed in the BiOS to take 13th gen CPUs too, but do your research on those before going that route. This one will serve you well. :)"

Upgrading to this has been more than significant. As of this writing, I hope you've done your research the I7-12700k's price point and its competition. For this price point, it may be the top dog.Some things to consider before purchasing:1) Make sure you are purchasing a LGA 1700 motherboard. I went with the DDR4 motherboard because DDR5 is still at its infancy. The DDR5 ram may not be the best option for your buck right now. You'll be fine with DDR4.2) This CPU does consume a lot more power compared to its predecessor. Double check if your PSU will be enough. There are online resources that will help you calculate your PSU. It's always good to have a little overhead.3) Make sure your heatsink has retrofit screws that's compatible with this motherboard. You can purchase them separately. If you have a heatsink that's very old (<2016), it's more than likely it may not be compatible.Good luck!"

So far it's impressive.  It runs much cooler than my i9-9900k (mild OC) ( 59C-63C under a gaming load vs 75C+) but that could've been due to the my old AIO being in it's death throws for the past few months.  3DMark CPU score went up noticeably as well.  Overall, I'm pretty happy with it.  Haven't messed around with overclocking yet, but there doesn't seem to be as much headroom left as there used to be,  from what I've read 5.3 Ghz is about what you can expect.  The days of getting another 800Mhz - 1 Ghz+  over stock clocks out of a CPU are gone it seems."

As soon as I opened the shipping box I could tell it had been opened before. The edge was uneven and the label crease was loose. I put my X-acto Knife down (which is what you need or something similar to open these as the label is there for a reason) and with just the gentlest of pressure the label peeled away from the center where someone oh so nicely had finely cut the label horizontal to make it easy to fold one side back over the other and with just a quick once over it looked almost normal.If I hadn't opened a few of them already with Intel's fancy new packaging I probably would not have noticed but the way the packaging normally is, it is VERY precise, tight, even lines and you will not be easily or gently opening it up with a simple light finger pry.My biggest fear was there wasn't going to be a CPU in there at all but luckily the right CPU was in there that matched the container batch but if something is sold as new I don't do open boxes.Make sure to check your packages before opening. The seal should be nice and tight and straight. The edges of the back flap should be firm and secure against the other flap and the bottom line/edges should be even and exacting.Give a gentle pull on each corner of the box where the label keeps it sealed to make sure it hasn't been altered or tampered with. It should be VERY firm and unable to just pull open easily. Look at the condition of the box itself around that area and even the gold disk inside.Fresh, brand new i9 12900k's are very pristine and boxed with precision.Still, they are fantastic processors overall and a worthy upgrade from 10th and 11th gen."

Couldn't figure it out at first and found myself checking my AIO, reapplying thermal paste, checking settings, etc.  After research I was able to discover that given it a slight undervolt helps. What ended up helping even better and easier was ticking down the performance in the Performance Menu.In those option by simply ticking down the processor to 99% my temps went down to 55 for most of my games from initially running at average 80-85.  This tuning comes without a noticeable hit on FPS except while playing ""Squad"" (a single core use cpu intensive game).  With that game I do lose at least 10 fps by having the processor at 99%.  This is not that big of a deal as I can easily tick it up to 100% for Squad and just put up with the 75-80 temps!Happy that I can at least play most of my games at a good temp while gaining good performance by this upgrade!"

The motherboards for the LGA-1200 required only small changes in production spec, and the coolers made for the 1151 chips work perfectly on the LGA-1200.  By contrast, the 12th generation, using the LGA-1700 socket, required an extensive redesign of motherboards, and the coolers that got adapted over from the LGA 1151/1200 didn't really work properly on the 12th and 13 generation Intel CPUs.

I purchased (1) of the most graphic intensive AAA game titles and a few CPU intensive military strategy simulation games known for their heavy demand for CPU physics computations. My Core i9-11900K which I purchased in 2022  performed admirably well on all accounts. Absolutely no complaints. Some reports say that the i9-11900K runs hot and sometimes above the 100Â°C mark? But that was not really the case with me or the many others when they installed a high quality 360mm or above sized AIO water cooler. My very demanding combat simulation (Command: Modern Operations) never presented a heating issue with the i9-11900K and with my over 80-hours of heavy duty play. For good measure my Cosmos C700M EATX case also includes a total of (7) additional  independent Noctua cooling fans, which of course benefits the cooling within the massive interior of the enclosure.

The reason I upgraded from my current i910900k is that I wanted to enable the NVME.2 4.0 on my SSD. I already had the drive and a Z590 motherboard so why not right? I put the new i9 11900k In and it started and enabled the 4.0 on my NVME. Yay right! Literally with in a couple minutes I received a watchdog timeout error. (This is caused by CPU cores failing to communicate with each other.)I called Intel tech support who was less than help full. I updated all drivers and still didn't work.I did notice my CPU temp was running over 100c. Odd because I have the best nactura CPU cooler they sell. I decided to upgrade to a liquid CPU cooler and that brought my CPU temp down to around 85c.That still didn't fix the time out errors. I put my old CPU back and all is happy. I ended up sending the i9 11900k back but at least my i9 10900k is nice and cool even at 45% overclock. LOL

I recently got my hands on the Intel Core i9-12900K Desktop Processor, and I have to say, I am blown away by its performance. This processor is an absolute powerhouse, with 16 cores (8P+8E) and speeds of up to 5.2 GHz. It's also unlocked, which means I can push its limits even further if I want to.Installing the processor was easy enough, although I did have to make sure my motherboard was compatible with the LGA1700 socket and 600 series chipset. Once I had everything set up, I fired up my favorite games and applications to see how the processor would perform.The results were nothing short of impressive. The i9-12900K chewed through every task I threw at it with ease, from demanding video editing software to the latest AAA games. I was able to multitask without any lag or slowdowns, and my system felt incredibly responsive and snappy.The processor also runs surprisingly cool, even under heavy load. I did notice a slight increase in power consumption compared to my old processor, but it's a small price to pay for the sheer performance boost.Overall, I am extremely satisfied with the Intel Core i9-12900K Desktop Processor. If you're a power user or a gamer who demands the best performance, this processor is definitely worth considering. It's not cheap, but in my opinion, it's worth every penny for the sheer power and speed it delivers."

The individual cores aren't significantly different from those in the 13th generation i7. But if you have a need for a lot of parallel processing then this may be the processor for you. I do software development, which it doesn't help 99% of the time, gaming, which it helps a little, and occasionally transcoding large amounts of video and music. During transcoding it helps a huge amount. I have over 300GB of FLAC audio files that I ripped from my CD collection, I never buy mp3s. I wanted to have that on my phone, but I didn't want to carry it at full rate because I can't tell the difference in the car, so I transcoded it. I had done that once before and it took more than a day on a five year old Ryzen 7. This machine took around 30 minutes. 30-40 times faster. At work the optics team, which uses ray tracing software to design optical telescopes and laser focusing lenses, uses i9s in preference to Xeons. The Xeons might be faster under some circumstances, but the machines are hugely expensive, so the i9s are much better for price performance. Would I buy it again? I'd probably buy the 13th generation, but if I had any sense I'd just get the 13th gen i7."

Put a minor overclock to 5.2 ghz and it's been so nice. P cores are freed up to do what they're supposed to do. E cores do the chores! Was hot at first before undervolting, but now that's done and temps are high 70s with a 360 mm Corsair AIO. Paired up with a Z690 from MSI and a RTX 3090 it's just the perfect combo. 12900K is completely free to do the data processing for the game, and 3090 handles the graphics side in all my triple A titles without needing to borrow from the system memory at all - needing to pull data through the processor. Resizable bar enabled and it's been awesome. Was worth every penny."

I upgraded from the 9900K and this has been a noticeable difference. I'm still in the process of updating drivers and reinstalling some software. I haven't done any overclocking so the Cinebench score and temps are straight stock settings.After seeing all the info on how hot this thing can get I added the Thermalright contact frame. It was a breeze to install. I watched the Gamer's Nexus video about this frame and followed their directions.For the motherboard I went with a MSI Z690 MPG Edge Wifi DDR4 so I could reuse my current RAM. I had to order a LGA 1700 bracket for the NZXT Kraken X73 AIO. I ordered both the frame and the LGA 1700 mount from Amazon and both arrived fast and were exactly what I needed.So far my temps are staying in the general range of my 9900K. I'm planning to do a little gaming this week with it so I'll have a chance to see how it does under my daily use. I also do a bit of Premiere and After Effects so I'm looking forward to seeing how it works there as well.Overall, this is probably way more processor than I NEED. I was still able to do what I needed to do with the 9900K. I built the 9900K in 2020 during the height of the astronomically high PC price wave. I ended up getting this processor for about $100 less than I paid for the 9900K two years ago. So the price-to-performance upgrade for me was a no brainer.If you want a fast processor at a reasonably decent price, this is a great one to get. Just be aware you will need to pay attention to your cooling."

Paired with said gpu and a MSI Tomahawk Z690 with a Noctua NH-D15 Chromax Black cooler, this cpu runs complete marathons around my old 8086k. Certain games that would fully saturate my 8086k while also getting notifications from something like Discord would introduce very bad stutter, however those are completely eliminated with the 12900k. Temps are high when Im doing full resolution photo renders from my DJI Air 2S or Sony a6400 or straight up benchmarking, but that is expected and I'm not one to sweat about 80-90c temps, but if you are I would recommend the 12700k/5900x as they both run cooler and draw less wattage. However in gaming with multiple different Firefox tabs and discord/telegram open, it never even touches 70c, so your experience may vary depending on what type of work load you are doing. Make sure that if you do have a high powered gpu that you also have a high output power supply with a high efficiency rating as well, as my system can suck north of 600-750w full tilt (my power supply being a 1200w platinum EVGA that doesnt break a sweat under full load)."

Paired it with 6400 mhz DDR5 memory on a AsRock z690 Taichi motherboard  and my Nvidia EVGA 3080Ti and I'm consistently in the top 5% of benchmarks world-wide with barely any tweeks except selecting the XMP profile in my bios. Blows away anything currently AMD is offering in the same price range.
