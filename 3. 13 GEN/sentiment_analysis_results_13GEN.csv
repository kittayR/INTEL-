(With a Few Quirks),,"The Intel Core i5-13600K is the latest champion in the mid-range desktop processor arena, promising top-notch gaming performance and efficient multitasking. But does it reign supreme, or face dethronement by rivals? Let's sharpen our critical swords and delve into its strengths and weaknesses:Pros:Performance Powerhouse: 14 cores (6 P-cores + 8 E-cores) and 20 threads deliver exceptional performance for gaming, content creation, and demanding workloads. Compared to its predecessor, the 12600K, it offers a significant performance leap.Gaming Prowess: Tears through even the most graphically demanding games with ease, boasting high frame rates and smooth gameplay at 1080p and beyond.Multitasking Maestro: Handles heavy multitasking like a champ, effortlessly juggling multiple applications, browser tabs, and demanding tasks simultaneously.Overclocking Champion: Unlocked multiplier allows for enthusiast-level overclocking, squeezing even more performance out of the silicon for those seeking ultimate power.DDR5 and PCIe 5.0 Support: Future-proofed with support for the latest DDR5 memory and PCIe 5.0 technology, ensuring compatibility with cutting-edge hardware upgrades.Cons:Power Hungry Prince: This performance comes at a cost, with a higher TDP (125W) and potential for increased power consumption compared to lower-power alternatives.Temperature Tantrums: Can run hot under heavy load, requiring beefy cooling solutions to maintain optimal performance and prevent thermal throttling.Pricey Pedigree: Carries a premium price tag compared to some Ryzen 5 competitors offering similar performance in certain scenarios.Windows 11 Preference: While technically compatible with Windows 10, Intel recommends Windows 11 for optimal performance and feature utilization.Motherboard Matchmaking: Requires a newer LGA 1700 motherboard, adding to the overall upgrade cost.Verdict:The Intel Core i5-13600K is a force to be reckoned with in the mid-range gaming processor category. Its exceptional performance, overclocking potential, and future-proof compatibility make it a tempting choice for serious gamers and creators. However, the higher power consumption, price tag, and potential thermal issues require careful consideration.Overall Rating: 4.5 out of 5 stars (with a slight temperature-related deduction)Should You Buy It?Absolutely! If you're a hardcore gamer or demanding content creator seeking the best value for performance in the mid-range, and aren't afraid of a little thermal taming, the 13600K is a top contender.Consider alternatives: If budget, power consumption, or Windows 10 compatibility are major concerns, explore Ryzen 5 options or consider the slightly less powerful (and cooler) i5-13500."

If you're upgrading to 13th gen Intel, and don't require the additional non-gaming related benefits of 13700k or 13900k, you can't go wrong with the i5-13600k.

Granted, I have a very good case for airflow, but regardless it's extremely rare I ever see this CPU hitting the 70's when gaming (this includes 1440p gaming at basically maxed settings), with plenty of utilization headroom on top of that. I paired this beastly CPU with the Sapphire Nitro Plus Radeon 6950XT & have been having an amazing experience all around. If you're deeply considering 13th gen, & your main focus is gaming, then the 13600k will perform up there with the best without all the additional heat the higher end SKU's give off. Genuinely give this CPU a 10/10, never in my life did I ever anticipate an i5 to be this great, but just goes to show it's more about the generation and less about the number after the i.

At 70 fewer watts than the i9-13900K you can actually cool the thing on air and enjoy similar single core performance, and with a respectable multicore performance score as well.My chip actually runs faster than Passmark says it should, but that might be because of my RAM. I got the K chip to get faster DDR5 speeds, not faster clock speeds, since I'm on air cooled, but at 5.1GHz I'm not for want of more cycles.My last CPU was an AMD Ryzen 7 4750G. Respectable for its day, but when I saw the performance of this Intel I decided it was time for me to switch back.My recommendation is that if you're running an air cooled gaming system, strongly consider this chip even if you have the cash for a 13th gen i9.

I have had the ryzen since launch.I was expecting similar performance maybe slightly better. However, this i5-13400f not only performs better than my old ryzen. It also does it at much cooler temps then the ryzen put out. My ryzen idled at 35c and got up to around 79c on heavy load. The i5 idles at 22c and has only gotten as high as 55c max under heavy land. That's 13 degrees cooler than the ryzen at idle and 24 degrees cooler under load.With that said that's a huge improvement over my old ryzen. Which I shouldn't be surprised that ryzen is a few generations old now. But damn. Definitely worth grabbing one.My old ryzen would get bogged down if I created a video game asset in blender around if I went too crazy. So far the i5 hasn't been bothered by anything I do in blender. Or in zbrush, maya, 3ds max, or substance painter."

Coming from a long time AMD user, this intrigued me.So far, it's got it's ups and downs.  But it seems to be at par with the Ryzen 7 5700g.  Though better in lots of ways....like, being to use either DDR 4 or 5.  Or PCIe 4 or 5, depending on mother board.  While the Ryzen 7 5700g is stuck at PCIe 3.Anyway, I loved it.  But decided to swap with with a i9 14900k.I donated it to a friend along with a few other parts to upgrade her system from an A10 to this.  So far it's been real good to her.The only odd note about this processor and it's IGPU counterpart is, this one have more cache.  While the IGPU version have less cache.  Try to weigh in your options when looking at this over the other.  I picked this due to a tiny drop in price with the added extra cache.  But, it wouldn't be great for my itx rebuild I did later on.  This low powered CPU (compared to a Ryzen 7 5700g) would benefit with the IGPU when going for a plain HTPC build."

This processor at an affordable price more than doubled, maybe tripled my cpu performance while still accepting my older DDR4 3200 ram and m.2 storage.  Also allows me to update my machine to Windows 11 as a 13th gen cpu.  I considered running 8th gen chip in my older mother board by flashing the bios with a coffee lake chip support, but rather than deal with all the isolation on the cpu pins and bios frustration, i opted to spend 60 bucks for a new MATX board and this cpu.  The only complaint I have is the cpu box was clearly opened and I am left wondering if this was dropped into someone else's board at some point and returned.  I don't like that when the product is being advertised as new.  The seller was Amazon LLC too so I am not sure what is going on with that.  I have half a mind to return it for a replacement but alas it is installed and seems to be running fine so I really don't want to pack it up and ship it back.  My chip runs pretty cool with the stock fan, 3d mark cpu stress tests never took it above 71C but that fan sure kicked in when the cpu was running at 100% utilization.  At idle on my computer the chip purrs along at 30-35C with the fan running somewhere around 40%.  All in all a good purchase to get my machine ready for Win 11.  Will work for a budget gaming build but expect to pay a little more for a good GPU."

The problem is the much too high power consumption and the associated thermal problems.Even with a 360 AIO water cooler (bequiet Silent Loop 2), the CPU goes to over 100°C under load and is then automatically throttled. So in order to achieve a reasonably reasonable volume level, you have to undervolt (turn down the voltage) in the bios and limit the maximum power consumption. There are recommendations of 125W on the mains, which limits the performance of the CPU by about 10-15%. The joke is, if you set the power consumption to about 170-180W you can achieve even more power (e.g. Cinebench), because the CPU is then no longer throttled due to thermal problems. So if you feel like playing around in the BIOS and with Intel XTU in order to have a reasonably acceptable level after hours, you can go for the experiment.

I purchased the most up to date CPU and other components with the hope this one will last me as long as the last one did. Overall I think this is a great CPU, however it is a bit frustrating when you try to cool these things. Intel just keeps pushing these CPUs harder and harder to try and beat the performance metrics of AMD, but in the process they are making CPUs that are anywhere from near impossible to difficult at best to keep cool. After a lot of tweaking in the BIOS I finally got this one to stay below the 90 degree Celsius threshold, but that doesn't account for how hot it still makes my room when I'm gaming. The extra heat was kind of nice during the winter months, but as summer is approaching I'm wondering how this is going to pan out...Anyway, the CPU is completely as advertised and worked flawlessly out of the box. I didn't run into any errors or issues with this CPU. Overall I 100% recommend it because Intel has never let me down. I've been building my own systems for more than 20 years now too, so that's a pretty long track record of CPUs that just worked and never died. Because of that I can easily recommend this CPU and I would definitely order it again."

Currently, my idle temps are around 41c and at 100% utilization, temps average around 60-70 with a quick peak of 95. I dont personally like to overclock for my own reasons, but I did do some overclocking on this for testing and everything worked great with what I did. 13th Gen blows away 12th gen.

I bought an ASRock z790 PG lightning /d4 board to go with it so I could use my existing DDR4 ram.  The difference was night and day!  I have an ID-Cooling 280mm AIO (cheapest I could find on Amazon) with a contact frame and kyronaut thermal grizzly extreme paste and does not thermal throttle on Cinebench R23 unless I run 3 or 4 passes back to back.  I am thrilled with how well this CPU runs.I was able to bump my DDR4 up to 4200mhz in gear 1 (timings cl20/26/26/26/48) after a bios update from ASRock and this thing is rock solid and crazy fast!  I get an average of 30500 in cinebench r23 and it will overclock as far as you want - I have taken it to 5.7 and it runs fine, it just thermal throttles quickly at that speed.  I'm pretty sure I could overclock this beast to the moon if I threw a lot more money into a custom cooling loop, but it is plenty fast as is.  I have no regrets about not bumping up to the 13900k, I do gaming and code compiling and it is a dream for both of those workloads."

This 13th gen i7 K is officially Intel's fourth fastest CPU on paper but in real life it's the fastest of them all in terms of stability as the the three slated above it (13900k,14700k and 14900k) are all plagued with issues that Intel won't discuss but admits to, albeit grudgingly. Until a fix-all patch is released, the 13700k is the best choice for gamers and content creators who won't be bothered with unpredictable bugs and BSOD fests. What good is it having a Ferrari but with an engine that's goes offline 20 times a day?  May as well go with a Porsche that works. At that level of performance these high-end CPU's more or less all perform equal (or would if they all worked properly), but it's easy to understand the frustration of owners whose 30-day window for return to Amazon is closed."

According to HWMonitor, the CPU package hovers around 15W power consumption doing desktop tasks (web browsing / email / Office).Compared to my i7-6700K (video card and PSU unchanged; new motherboard, ram, and heatsink&fan):- System power consumption at idle and doing desktop tasks is about 5W higher than my 6700K in normal mode, or about 15W lower in âecoâ mode in my motherboardâs settings- Synthetic benchmarks (3dmark CPU Profile) indicate 2x performance for single-core processing and 4x performance for maximum threads- Real-life video encoding is roughly 3x faster using PowerDirectorNote that this LGA1700 socket is known to allow some bending (this causes poorer contact with heatsink which may cause throttling). This can be remedied by installing a pressure plate (I bought a Thermalright LGA1700-BCF for around $12).If you donât need a built-in GPU, consider the i7-13700KF; the built-in GPU is nice to have but not always worth the premium.

During the Cinebench stress test you get temps that max out at 98 - 100 degrees Celsius, but remember that's absolute max mode, 99% of users will never use this CPU for more than several minutes at. If Intel's Extreme Tuning Utility does not automatically download when installing, definitely get it from intels website and learn to use it. It is easy to use, and you won't regret it. I just use it for monitoring performance, but you can use it for easy optimize and under/overvolt with too, but I'd recommend doing any of that through your motherboard BIOS if you decide to. Most new BIOS's are easier and safer for that kind of stuff anyway. Do your research on which to use and how.

I have Crucial RAM 64GB Kit (2x32GB) DDR5 4800MT/s CL40 Desktop Memory CT2K32G48C40U5 modules (4 of them), a Corsair RM1000x (2021) Fully Modular ATX Power Supply in a Phanteks Enthoo Pro Full Tower Chassis without Window Cases PH-ES614PC_BK in service for about one year as I write this review. For the most part, assembly was very easy. I do video editing, audio editing, streaming, wordprocessing, browsing and email with my setup. I use all of my SATA ports and even have a plug-in eSATA card for more ports. So most of my drive bays are filled. The cpu, dram and everything I have connected to my power supply and motherboard has been rock solid stable, and the case holds in all together. It just works exactly the way I want and have no anomalies. The power supply, motherboard and all components run cool in the case with an i7-13700K CPU, 128 GB of Crucial DDR5-4800 that is clocked at 5200 automatically set by the motherboard itself. My video card is a the very modest ASUS GeForce GT 1030 2GB GDDR5 HDMI DVI Graphics Card (GT1030-2G-CSM) because I transitioned my ancient setup from MBR to GPT and needed to be able to boot the old system in the new motherboard before updating the Windows 10 Pro config to GPT UEFI and still be able to boot legacy devices. Everything just worked like a Swiss Chronograph. I strongly recommend this cpu, dram, the power supply, the case, the ASUS ProArt Z790-Creator WiFi 6E LGA 1700, the Asus video card, and am also recommending the Crucial MX500 SATA drives I use. Is it all of this the fastest? I have no idea. Does it boot and work reliably everytime so far? Absolutely!"

This thing is amazing!,,"I built a new computer during the height of covid (Dummy, I know, right?) and decided on a i9-9900k. I'm a sysadmin by trade, so remoting in and fixing servers has never been an issue with that processor..but for gaming..Titles like Cyberpunk, Days Gone, to even WoW..there were areas that my 3080 was being bottlenecked by the 9900k.I coupled this CPU with a MSI EDGE z790 DDR4 (I have fantastic Samsung B-Die CL14 3600 DDR4 from the previous build). So far, in Cyberpunk I'm seeing 25-30 more FPS on 1440p Ultra settings w/ Raytraycing on High. WoW is getting 50+ more FPS, and I'm getting over 100 FPS in Valdrakken, where I was getting 45-50 FPS with the 9900k with the same settings as cyberpunk (1440p ultra (10 graphics settings).I'm using the Corsair iCUE H100i Elite LCD 240mm AIO, with Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut Extreme thermal paste to cool this bad boy, and even at prolonged sessions in Cyberpunk, my temps are not getting above 65c. And no, I have not done the Contact Plate mod.TL;DR - This CPU is blazing fast, and if your current processor is a few years old it may very well be worth the upgrade.

Please note I used an older Z690 EVGA Classified Board. I was required to flash because older boards cannot support the new CPU yet. I suggest people who used a 12th gen chipset and were looking to upgrade follow their respective motherboardâs vendor manual. The installation was incredibly easy, and I booted the BIOS after the BIOS update without any problem. I had hit 5 GHz on the CPU without overclocking. It also supported 6000 MHz DDR5 RAM without any issues after enabling XMP. The reasonable pricing for Z690 or Z790 boards makes the i7-13700K a good combo compared to AMDâs expensive Ryzen 7000 CPUs and motherboard costs. For people who are still on older generations, the vast E cores and P cores offered by Intelâs 13th gen make it worth it to accomplish CPU-intensive tasks like Handbrake or Adobe Premiere. This CPU runs cool with a 360 mm AIO and a high airflow case (around 30-36 C idle temperature for me).

So I don't know if the problem is with the processor or if I have a board compatibility issue, but I think I should not have had a board compatibility issue, and I have a 900 W power supply so there's no reason why there wasn't enough power to boot, I also used a liquid cooler so it should have had zero heat problems. I put a 12,900K on my motherboard from a 12700 KF which is what came with the computer, and the 12900K boots just fine. I am running a Lenovo legion t5 Gen 7.

Intel has finally acknowledged this issue, search ""Regarding Reports of 13th/14th Gen Unlocked Desktop Users Experiencing Stability Issues"" on google.For me, worked great for about a month, then slowly started experiencing stability issues. Games would crash and get an occasional blue screen. After about 6 months, there were noticeable stability issues, with many games unable to boot past main menu, causing blue screen on launch, or experiencing frequent crashes. Friends in separate friend groups would always comment on my computer issues, showing bugs and crashes that have no apparent causes.After a year, my PC can only run super smash brothers melee with stability and even chrome tabs are crashing now. Discord has to be run on chrome because the app crashes every 10 seconds, I can't play any games. I had dedicated tens of hours into investigating only to realize it's been the CPU all along. I also had to upgrade my motherboard to accommodate this CPU and now I have to investigate if this CPU has caused irreparable damage to the motherboard. I expect Intel will be facing heavy financial losses due to influx of warranties as the issues become more and more public.Please look up ""Intel 13th and 14th Gen stability"" for more info, or ""Intel Raptor Lake stability"" on Google for further cases.

They take it in, and in 2 days message me saying its the CPU.  They tried the CPU in a different motherboard and the issue still shows up.  So, i go and pick up the machine.I try to file a warrenty claim with Intel, but their login system was broken for a week, so I had to chat with a support person.  We spend 1 hour typing about the issue.  I send him screenshots of the CPU itself, the text from Microcenter, the recepit from Amazon, screenshot of the Bios showing all my hardware information, a screenshot of the recepit from microcenter, a screenshot of the error code.I wait a week or so, i can finally log into Intel website, and i dont see a support ticket.  I open up chat again,  i tell them my ticket and they tell me that it wasnt assigned to an email address.  They assign it and forward the support response to me.And the response says, they cant contact Microcenter to confirm it.  And that its not a CPU issue anyways because that code is due to an OS issue.An OS issue.  I ask them to reiterate their point, because if its an OS issue, that means they dont believe me and Microcenter.  I also pointed out again that i have installed Windows 10 and 11 at least 5 times.... and they respond with, i need documentation from Microcenter.  So, they dont believe me and they believe this is an OS issue still.It has been 11 days and they wont move forward unless I send the documentation from Micro Center now.Works great, but hope you never have to file a warrenty claim because its going to take at least a month and thats if your lucky."

I am using liquid cooling on top of this. And yet it hit 80Â°C. What I was doing when that happened was trying to open a game. And one thing that I missed was to disable the integrated graphics because I have dedicated GPU. It was just for a moment the CPU was used during the game launch and after it started using the GPU. But until that switch happened, under less than a minute of CPU usage, it reached to 80Â°c. I mean since these are premium products, there should be some protection layers blocking such usages, and close the programs instead rather than hitting its performance.But anyways, I disabled the integrated device and then it's all smooth. Everything normal except for that one instance explained above. Parallel processing is still shitty though with Windows OS. Same kind of processors on Mac before Apple silicon came in were working more efficiently. So I guess it's prob with windows OS, but not processors."

This is a genuinely powerful CPU that's been able to handle basically every task that I've thrown at it. It runs demanding tasks like encoding and gaming with ease.Now with that out of the way; Thermals. This thing gets hot, and I mean REALLY hot. If you're going with air cooling I strongly recommend a double tower, six/eight pipe Air cooler like the Corsair A115 or a Cooler Master MA824. If you are going the AIO route, anything LESS than a 360mm AIO will under perform. For that, go with any 360mm AIO from any brand of your choice. If you have the space, go with a 420mm AIO for the best results.Finally, there has been recent reports of CPU degradation and instability when using this CPU. I am using this with an asus ROG STRIX Z790-H motherboard and it basically JUICED the CPU like no tomorrow until I applied intel's Power settings for this CPU. This likely is the cause of the degradation. Be sure to check intel's website for recommended power settings. Also check your motherboard vendor for any bios updates as Intel has confirmed that many motherboard vendors are running the i9 13900k CPU out of intel's specifications.In conclusion here's my personal experience: The CPU functions, but I can not use Asus' AI Overclocking feature as I get a BSOD with the CLOCK_WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT error and apps will randomly crash. You probably shouldn't use any AI assisted overclocking feature if you can help it. Even running this at stock, there is still a substantial amount of performance in this CPU. If you have an older rig and are looking to upgrade your CPU, I would just wait for Meteorlake or just go with AMD.Final note: I am not using a contact frame on my motherboard for my CPU."

We hooked up measurement of power draw and temperature readings of the CPUs and was shocked that this one was drawing 450W as others were showing < 200W.  And temperature went up to 100C while the others were at 70C.One system had a glitch where if you ran python and import numpy, it would reboot.  We determined the problem was that PSU only supported +12V rail at 20A.  We switched to a 600W PSU that supports +12V @50A and it worked flawlessly.  So watch out that your PSU supplies sufficient amps at +12V.Ordered a replacement, replacement brand new would not boot up.  We swapped back old CPU from, and it boots up but runs hot again.  This one we had to reduce workload to 75% of other systems to cool it down.So 2 out of 10 desktops are defective  This is a huge surprise.

Once I discovered that I had to slow the memory down from the 6600MHz XMP rating to 6200MHz, the board/cpu combo has worked very reliably  (multiple passes of OCCT Gold stress test).  Just checking the XMP II box,  the 6200MHz box and the (so called) AI overclocking box in the bios gives a score of 40K on Cinebench R23 so it's plenty fast -- the loss of 400MHz memory bandwidth isn't a big deal.  I tried various other adjustments but the latter turned out to be sufficiently fast and very reliable.  My current chip has a Silicon Predictor(SP) of 99 (roll of the dice).  I suspect that higher SP levels while possible are rare.I am using a ARCTIC Liquid Freezer II 360  AIO which works OK but the CPU can run hot.  The mother board cooling prediction for said AIO is 155 but that is not really enough for this chip to run all out.  It is easy to get this CPU up to 100C using OCT Power Stress test.  While the CPU might run at 100C for a long time, it will not do it any good and it will not run reliably -- I needed to check the 90C max box in the bios to get it to pass the OCCT power stress test.  I have a RTX 4090 and in the OCCT power test the net system power gets up to 1100W.  Normal gaming so far never gets to such power levels but still worth considering.FWIW, I have had a CPU apparently fail from running the OCCT Power Stress test.  If you want to run this CPU all out with reasonable temps, you really need significant cooling.  I doubt any AIO will work for this.  I suggest an open loop system with something like a Watercool MO-RA3 420 PRO radiator.All said, If you are building a gaming system, you would be just as well served with a ASUS ROG Strix Z690-E and a i9-12900KF CPU.  It will be easier to cool and will save you some money for a better graphics card which will make *much* more difference in most games than the CPU."

However, with some tweaking, you're likely to get up to 6.2 Ghz boost behavior for single-core loads, and bump up the all-core boost to 5.7 Ghz (up from 5.5 Ghz stock). With some further tweaking of the voltage-frequency curve, you could probably tweak this even further. I'm not a big fan of all-core overclocks on these type of processors, as you will lose the boosting single-core speed. In my opinion, this processor shines for gaming because of its single-core boosting performance.Memory controller has been significantly improved over Alder Lake. I was easily able to get my DDR5 6400 XMP profile running without any tweaking. I'm pretty sure this can be easily pushed further, but it seems like around 6400 Mhz memory is the roughly the sweet spot in terms of price vs performance.Very power hungry, but despite the bad reputation from reviewers, the power consumption can be easily tamed. If you run power limits unlocked, you will likely be thermal limited due to thermal throttling at 100c. However, you don't need unlocked power limits - you're talking about a very small 5-10% performance uplift but using >100W more power to achieve this. I would suggest running it at stock power limits, or unlocked power limits but seriously consider undervolting.On a final note, I wouldn't consider getting the rumored 6.0 Ghz version of the 13900K in the future. The current 13900K can easily be pushed to >6 Ghz boost speeds and will save you money."

I âve been wanting a cpu with an IGPU for years, but couldnât justify the price increase on the gpu version. I actually use a dgpu but it really is convenient, and they can be used to accelerate some work. Again, before you judge i'm using this for work, productivity. NOT gaming. I would spend 200 for a gaming cpu.my use case is productivity. iâm a developer, and this is the sole reason i upgraded. I was fighting windows freezing and slowing down during a lot of my workflows. I use wsl intellj, docker, react apps java etc, often at the same time. Itâs pretty noticeable the improvement. It really helped.  Like that i could use ddr4 for now since the boards are about 150 it was acceptable.Heat: The cpu gets a bad reputation due to heat and wattage. I put this in the bucket frankly that amd got as well. I mean itâs fine they are using as much power as needed to maximize perf. I limited the cpu to 250w, and it runs on a d15 cooler than my 5900, Full load can get up to high 80c, but working is 30âs. you lose very little perf by running it more in the zone. I don't know about other boards but that msi one sure makes it easy and the price if right.About the cpu: it has a ton of cores, I didn't need to buy ddr5--  i need quite a lot of ram and it still costs too much for the benefit it provides in my workload. The memory controller on 13gen is far better than ryzen 5000 series. I couldn't before get my ddr4 stable at 4000 on the 5900x and it did it on the intel one immediately. Indeed i was even able to tighten up the timings just a touch. So modern processors (and i'd assume the amd ones as well) have made welcome improvements to memory support. Id' say if you don't need as much ram say 32gb, and you don't have ddr4 already to tide you over i'd consider getting ddr5 though.  I mean nothing is cheaper than what you have and 4k speed is fine. If i had nothing or maybe some old ram i'd go w/ ddr5.Price: For 570 itâs decent deal here. It is more than i love spending, but for what you get it is a lot better than what amd is offering at the time i write this which was 700.I do wish intel supported board reuse down the line, but that even can. be overblown (to an extent, and only an extent) though it's a selling feature to me frankly reuse!! I had to really think about that. I don't understand why intel is so stubborn on this subject.  with my amd cpu i went from 2700x to 5900x and the board went from a 470 to 570 because i waned more io and better pcie but i also gave that board to my kid and upgraded it one time. With intel especially I mean i just buy cheap boards anyway and upgrade more because there are a ton of features that get added half the time. I usually try to spend about 150 on a board, though it. is getting harder but it would be more my preference. I 'm not really onboard with the 600 motherboards. Is there a  300 one in-between i guess so but that's equally unappealing to me esp w/ out the upgrade.Tips/A rant if you will: trust me on this that msi board for 159 is so amazing. It really works great. donât worry about the vrm. thatâs also very overblown too. you can go calculate the amperage this will not come close. ALso msi is a great brand and the bios is easy to navigate. If you want fancy audio buy a dac that you can reuse and plug into usb and keep reusing it. Just think about what you really need in there. The msi board has a nice selection of pcie slots and well placed nvme. I use multiple gpu one nvidia gpu quatro for encoding (its a small one) and and amd one 6900 i bought for 570 for gaming. I just really love the layout connectivity and features of the board. They cut all the stuff i don't need and pared with the cpu it's all together about 700 for a cpu and board, pretty much as good as you can get."

Too warm, really.UPS says the computer is using 575 watts during the CPU stress test, about 175 watts at idle. TPU is 253w ... so with the 80%+ PS inefficiency, 300w makes sense.When using the 3080 GPU with the i9 CPU ... well, the heat coming from the case is similar to a 1000w space heater, really. Now reconsidering my choice for only an 850w PS. 1000w would probably be a better idea for this beast.As for speed. That's relative. But I am coming from an i9-7900x, and this is 3x faster, and it feels 3x faster. Memory is slower, (4ch vs 2ch) -- so I had to use DDR5-6400 to get a similar memory bandwidth. Lost some latency, but the overall effect is the thing still seems plenty fast.I dislike the way the CPU case instantly jumps to 100c -- no thermal mass what-so-ever in the CPU case. Or I have a bad CPU without whatever filler Intel puts between the die and the case.In any case, Intel needs to allow for more thermal mass to reduce these thermal stresses of instantaneous temp changes. Has to be stressing the silicon and lead to more thermal stress failures."

I cannot delve into the technical nuances of this cpu like some can.  What I can tell you is this.  The i9-13900k has significantly increased my productivity.  Being able to run multiple CPU heavy applications completely changed the way I work.  Yes I know this CPU runs notoriously hot, but it seems a good quality AIO tames it well.  I have the 13900k running on an Gigabyte Z790 Aorus Master X motherboard with 128 gigs of ram and I use the NZXT Kraken 360 Elite to cool it.  The Kraken Elite does manage the heat well and my systems idles at 28-29 degrees.  This CPU is way overkill for a gamer, but for someone like me that does a lot of 3D modeling and rendering, its great.  I do have the cpu slightly overclocked using the Intel Extreme Tuning Utility in automatic overclock.  I have not had any crashes and havent noticed any thermal throttling at all with this setup."

Just a heads up to anyone who plans to pair 13900k with 4090, donât be a smartass and try to put it in small case, you will regret it later. I personally recommend big case with high airflow like fractal design torrent mid size atx but if you donât want to spend too much money on graphics card and happy with getting something like 4060 then you can get the nano version of fractal torrent. Good luck gamers and editors. Just remember if gaming is the only thing you do then no point spending this much just go a step down on processor.

Both worked the first time.  Do you need 24 cores for games?  Most games use 4 or 6 cores max, so probably not.  Video editing can benefit from the extra cores.  Intel supports XMP (extreme memory profile) and this processor is unlocked (it can be overclocked).  Overclocking increases the power consumption and heat; therefore, one needs a robust cooling solution.  Overclocking can void your warranty which is strange since Intel allows and even promotes overclocking with the Intel Extreme Tuning Utility.  I have the NZXT Kraken x 73 RGB liquid cooler.  With the NZXT CAM software you can see the CPU (and GPU) temperatures and control the fan speeds, reducing the risk of damaging the processor.  While idling (at 5.5 GHz) the CPU temperature is 30 C.  Under a 50% load or overclocked the temperatures are below 60 C.  Pros: Good for video editing Cons: A bit pricey for a gaming computer.  Don't overclock without monitoring temperatures to keep below 60 C."

The 7.04 firmware for that board does have Intel ME updates for this processor, so recommended.As to the CPU itself, as all other reviews state, it's the fastest and best for the price.Paired with the noted ASRock board, lots of power limit unlocking options available to set per your cooler capability."

I was rocking out the i7-7700K, so going from that to the i9-13900K is INSANE!  The difference in operations and performance results cannot be overstated.  Yes,  this cpu likes to run hot.  But with good cooling and nice airflow,  this cpu will handle whatever you throw at it.  I'm glad I finally took the leap to upgrade to this gem."

Itâs at least 7 or 8 times faster on multithreaded tasks. Probably 4 or 5 times faster than my work i7 9000 series. You can under lock it to reduce the wattage, but itâs already less watts at idle than the Ryzen 9 7950.  Mooreâs law isnât dead yet!"
