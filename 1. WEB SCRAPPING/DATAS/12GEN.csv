Dead on arrival",15-06-2023,"After troubleshooting with q-led lights i deduced it was the CPU. It was a surprise since the packaging didn't appear to be damaged. I don't know if it was transit or the supplier, but the product was dead on arrival. I took all precautions when installing the lga 1700 12gen Intel i3, so i can only speak of the state of the product when installed. I purchased an i5 at best buy to get the server going."

No actualiza si ya tenías un i3 10gen o parecido",24-09-2023,"I bought it because I believed that the new architecture and new technologies brought by Intel's 12th generation would be very different and more powerful than previous generations, but in my case there was only about 5% performance with this processor."

Great for productivity, but not the best for gaming.",05-11-2022,"To be clear, the i3-12100f performs as an excellent desktop processor for what it is, and if you're going to use it mainly for office tasks, browsing, YouTube, it'll do all of that effortlessly, and efficiently so at near or around half the wattage of it's Ryzen counterpart.Once you cross into PC gaming territory, results can be mixed. You have to be very careful about which GPU is paired with this i3 to prevent noticeable bottlenecks. I tried a few combinations, given how touted this was as a such a good budget option, and while it always seemed to work decent in GPU intensive games, CPU intensive games always suffered and exhibited massive amounts of stuttering and fps drops, even if the resolution was raised to 1440p and settings favored GPU. For reference I was using higher end cards to test, such as an MSI Trio RX 6800 and an EVGA RTX 3070 FTW3, and yes, I was aware it would bottleneck to begin with, but was hoping it would not be as severe as it was to serve as a temporary fix until I could upgrade later in the year. Many reviewers also glowed about how it could be paired with more high-end GPUs, but this clearly isn't the case for some games. Fortnite is one example that suffered massively. I wouldn't recommend pairing this with anything more than an RX 6600, RTX 3060, or something slightly older such as a GTX 1660 TI."

Luis Ramirez,3,Eeeee creí que era nuevo y no lo era jaja,12-01-2023,"Obviously the processor came out months ago and it doesn't have much use, it's like new in its box with the decal and everything, but the box was already open  haha But it was a good purchase, good price and as I said, since the 11th generation intel it's a good buy, although sometimes I use a 10th generation i3 and I don't complain about anything with 40gb of Ram,  Best regards."
Jason,3,Fan blade broke,15-10-2023,Overall CPU looks to work good still in BIOS but came to realize one of the CPU fan blades broke and when in turbo mode it makes the whole PC vibrate. Hoping to be sent a new cpu cooler or fan.

Powerful little beast",08-08-2023,"Amazing cpu for less then 100$. I put this into my build and it is VERY fast. I can play any game with no issues paired with Rx 6600. I would recommend upgrading to a better cpu in a year or 2 like a 12400F, but it isn’t necessary. If u are building a budget build then this is an awesome choice tho it will slowdown on you in a year or 2 so that’s why I’m gonna upgrade to 12400F soon"

No cooler mounting hardware",25-07-2023,"This CPU comes with a cooler and a diagram showing how to attach said cooler. However the diagram showed use of a bracket on the motherboard and it did not have one in the box.

Great for budget gaming",06-01-2023,"I'm pairing this with a 5700 XT, 16GB of DDR4 3200, and a 1TB NVME. I get a nearly locked 60fps at 4k in Forza Horizon 5 with high settings, and easily get a constant 60+ fps at 1440p with high settings in all games I play. If you're looking for a steady 60-75fps this CPU would pair well with any GPU up to a 6700xt or 3060ti in all but the most CPU intensive games (you may notice occasional dips in something like Cyberpunk). For general computing use it's more than adequate. It also run very cool using the stock cooler (doesn't go over 65° while gaming).For the $106 I paid I couldn't be happier, but I'll probably upgrade to an i5-12400/13400 when I get a more power GPU and/or a higher refresh rate monitor."

For the vaule, it doesn't really get much better",15-05-2023,"This cpu is what I use for bios updates on new builds, but the thing is a beast for personal use as well.I had this paired with a 3070ti to game with. I was able to play all games I wanted with over 100fps and no stuttering at 1440p. Obviously the 3070ti is where most of the load was going, but I've seen lots of people reviews saying this can barely handle 1080p. That wasn't the case here. I was able to play games like warzone 2.0, mw2, Doom eternal, and RDR2 at 1440p all while being able to use Discord as well."

Budget Gaming King",13-04-2024,"I used this to build a pc for my wife. The performance on this CPU (depending on supporting hardware) matches or exceeds many CPUs available at both similar and higher price points. If you are truly going for a budget build, it is hard to beat this below $100.I built her system with 16GB of DDR4 3200 ram, and an RX 6600 for the GPU, and she has no problem running anything either gaming or productivity.I don’t recommend going as cheap as you can on the motherboard, if you get this though. The performance on this can be great but you have to get supporting hardware to maximize it."
Charles Schroen,5,"5.0 out of 5 stars
Nice upgrade",24-03-2024,"This cpu is part of my upgrade from socket 1200 to socket 1700. This cpu is noticeably faster than the one it replaced, a 10th generation Intel i5. This cpu runs very cool and provides plenty of power for my everyday computing needs, which do not include gaming. My system currently runs the Zorin OS (Linux) smoothly and efficiently with temperatures sometimes under 30 degrees. Just remember that with this cpu you need a graphics card as the chip does not have that component. It is a nice touch that this cpu is compatible with either DDR4 or DDR5 memory. Just check the standards for the motherboard you intend to purchase. Best of luck with building your own desktop."

Better than the Ryzen 5 5500!!!",22-10-2023,"I didnt expect much from an i3, but once again I was blinded by the label. This product holds the price to performance of a console KILLER. It's single core power is up there with the ryzen 7000 series processors, supporting ddr5 ram at only 90 dollars WITH the cooler. Assuming your average cooler is about 10 dollars, you really can't go wrong with an 84 dollar cpu capable of 500+ fps on minecraft, 300+ fps on valorant, etc.I will say though, a quad core cpu in 2023 is a bit questionable, since you'll have extra issues streaming and recording games. The cache is also pretty low for this cpu, but you really can't hate too much on a 90 dollar cpu at this magnitude of performance.Overall solid cpu, more than I need for games and editing. DONT BE BLINDED BY THE I3 LABEL, IT PERFORMS UP THERE WITH RYZEN CPUS AND 10TH GEN I7S!!!"

More power than I'll ever need",20-01-2023,"This has enough power to play ALL games.  I don't have a single one in my library that uses more than 50% of this CPU.  It plays GTA 5, satisfactory, far cry 6, cities skylines, and it can even play UEBS 2 with 4 million A.I. enemies.  I've only ever seen this hit 100% on benchmarks.Just because it's an i3, don't think it's weak.  12th gen i3's are more powerful than i7's of older generations.Don't buy the i5, i7, or i9.  This is more than enough.Update 5-25-2024This processor is still going strong and can still play modern games.  Runs sons of the forest like a champ never hitting 100%.  Unfortunately I have found 2 games this struggles to run.  Star citizen and grey zone warfare.  It is 100% the entire time on both of these games.  Grey zone warfare can still run at 80fps on ultra settings at 4k, but Star citizen bogs down so bad it's almost unplayable.  But still, even in 2024 it's still a great buy and I still recommend."

Unbelievable it performs this well",17-07-2023,The price this little quad core comes in at really is incredible. Sure it's quad core but this is not the i3 of the past (well kinda is but you know what I mean). 4.3ghz single core with 8 threads means this think is a mini gaming beast. It can do 1440p gaming (with capable card of course) and I have been doing just that. The only reason I will be moving on from it is for the 6 core i3 in 14th gen. Best believe though I will be making another inexpensive PC with this when I upgrade. I have a spare 5500xt that should make for a quality 1080p second machine for when I visit home to my mom's. 5/5 stars.

They're better off not even including a cooler like they used to honestly. Spend a little extra (even $20ish) for a better cooler--you'll get better performance and the CPU won't run as hot."

En lecture de films, ou pendant l'écoute de musique, le processeur Intel et la carte graphique (GTX 1660 TI)  ne dépassent pas chacun les 35°c, et grimpent respectivement à 47°c et 62°c lors des sessions de jeux.Je précise que le 12100F est refroidi par un ventirad Low Profile Noctua NHL-12S, appuyé par un ventilateur Arctic P12, et est fixé au socket par un cadre d'ajustement, sensé éviter les déformations de la surface du processeur, de marque Thermalright.En terme de puissance, ce processeur peut-être associé à n'importe quelle carte graphique sans limiter le potentiel de cette dernière, sauf peut-être celles au-dessus des très puissantes AMD RX 6900 XT et des RTX 3080 TI.En applicatif en revanche, l'Intel pêchera un peu sans pour autant être ridicule. Sachez qu'elle a autant de répondant qu'un haut de gamme d'il y a 4 ans.Pour résumer, au regard du prix, le 12100F est ce qu'il se fait de mieux pour un ordinateur destiné à un usage polyvalent et économique."

CPU OK--Cooler is Worthless",24-02-2023,So far the CPU works as expected.  The included Intel CPU cooler is completely useless.  The installation process is obscure and the mounting system is terrible.  Basically plastic pop rivets which hold the fan to the motherboard.  The cooler did not work and the CPU temperature was almost 90 C.  The motherboard would not let me load software because of the high temperature warning.  I replaced the Intel unit with an after market cooler that works very well.  CPU temperature in now in the mid 20's.  A very disappointing experience and I think that I will use AMD processors next time.

Also, I had read about and was expecting to have thermal issues with the stock cooler until I received the water cooler I ordered, but the cooler has had no problems keeping the CPU cool under load. The only thing I did was removed the pre-applied paste and applied some MX-6 thermal paste. Overall, great budget CPU for gaming."

It RIPS!!",20-12-2022,"I’m honestly blown away by the performance of these 12th gen Intel chips. The single core performance is amazing, which is what will be important for most users. The multi core performance is fantastic as well. I have a “non-F” version in a workstation and this 12400F in a gaming rig (yes, I liked it enough to buy a second one.) It’s great for both use cases. I have it paired with an RTX 3080ti for gaming, and most of the time the CPU load is well under 50%. My favorite game only uses 1-4% of the processor lol. For reference, I game at 4K with maxed settings on a 55” TV, so at 1080p or 1440p, there may be more load shifted to the CPU. Still, I wouldn’t expect it to break a sweat under most titles, including AAA titles. Buy with confidence, and don’t fall victim to anyone telling you that you need an i9 to game. It’s just not necessary unless maybe you are a designer who wants just one computer that has the CPU horsepower for work and also can game in your spare time."

It's LGA 1700 so any motherboards that can use this CPU can also upgrade to 13th gen, and MAYBE even 14th gen.. all be it with BIOS updates. So if you need a ""hold over"" until you can go 13th or 14th gen. The 12400 / 12400f is an absolute terrific choice."

Excellent for budget builds",06-10-2022,"I don't do a lot of heavy gaming so this works well for me. I've paired it with an RTX 2060 and haven't had issues running games. However, the stock CPU fan doesn't seem to fit into my motherboard well (it is an ASUS Prime B660M-A) and struggles to keep cool when playing more intensive games. I plan to replace it with a different cooler soon anyway, but it's something to keep in mind. I think if the fan plays nice with your motherboard it should do just fine. I would also recommend replacing the stock thermal paste if you do use the included fan."

Horrible Efficiency",03-04-2024,"overall intel is great for a work station, HOWEVER the 14 series is stupid as hell... it offers NO benefit in 99.9% of situations over 13 series... I upgraded from a 12700k, and saw only minor improvements, and at the expense of power cost. My desktop now idles at 150-250 watts... before with my 12700k it was idling at like half that. in most cases a lot of people wont care, however being forced to live in a high cost of living state like CA, where electricity is $0.44 per kwh, that means just idling is costing me 0.11 per hour, that's $1000 a year just in idling... plus all the electricity my house uses. I'm only here temporarily (military) and will be moving as soon as retire, but its something to note.On top of that, its a straight refresh of the older 13th gen, and they blocked APO for the 13th and 12th gen and aren't working on getting it working across the board (only minor useless titles no one honestly cares about)...If it was a bit cheaper to go AMD, I would have went to a 7800x3d, but that would have cost me about 900 just to switch, due to having to buy new RAM (still on DDR4, 3600mhz/CL14) and Motherboard...There's also the constant issue of certain games/programs just refusing to run in Multithread/Multicore, or using the E-cores inappropriately. Intel really needs to sort out this trash..."

UPDATE: Been at this for days and days. Intel core i9-14900k on ASUS z790 Strix is a BSOD MACHINE. Previouslyit would run for many minutes. Now it barely goes one ir two minutes before freezing and a BSOD. Now I'm doing ASUS BIOS MemTest86 so far so good (for the RAM).While Windows 11 Pro was working I did the Memory Diagnostics and it said it passed. So either the CPU or the Motherboard is bad.New ASUS Z790 Strix, with new Intel i9-14900k, with new T700 2TB Gen5 PCIE 5 NVME M2, and new 64GB DDR5 6400 RAM, with Runs Windows 11 Pro. All drivers up and Windows are up to date.I've not done any overclocking or XMP in the bios to push the RAM 4000Mhz to the advertised 6400. I avoided buying RAM that can go 8000Mhz with XMP because there are so very many failures with those--and I wanted 8000 because I wanted a system with no bottlenecks as much as possible.Runs great for about 5 to 30 minutes. Temps run from 30s to 50s to high 80s bouncing up and down like normal. Then BOOM BSODs.I will do tests including memory, cpu, and double check drivers.Most websites point to a CPU issue. Some mention RAM or drivers.I'm either going to solve this issue or return this i9-14900 CPU and replace it with an i9-13900.I hope to remember this review and update it with success info."

BEWARE of the New LGA 1700 Socket",20-03-2024,"I've been a lifetime Intel diehard fan but man they really pushed a disappointing product out. This thing gets HOT, I've been building computers for a while but I've never seen a CPU regularly spike to 100 C with liquid cooling. My previous 8700k ran great and was fulling overclocked to 4.8GHz and I never saw anything higher than 78 C under 100% load. I was so sketched out by seeing the 14700k temps that I ran Intel's CPU diagnostic software and I couldn't even finish it! The temps got to a steady 93-100 C while testing so I had to cancel it and let the CPU cool down.I even tried some gaming with it and while playing Helldivers 2 at ""High/Medium"" settings It liked to hover at 95C and spiked constantly. This caused thermal throttling and game stutters followed with it. Even while at the desktop fully idle my temps would spike around from 25 C all the way up to 70 C. The reason for this is the new LGA 1700 socket ILM, you have to buy, replace, and correctly torque a WHOLE new socket brace just so you can kind of tame this CPU.I remember when Intel was known for keeping cool and AMD for getting hot. That's not the case anymore and I'm so disappointed because Intel was my go to with every single PC I ever built."

I installed it in my system and it would not boot - did not even get past the POST testing.  I uninstalled it and send back for a refund with a note that it was an open box and was defective.I give this only a single star across all categories as the processor arrived in an open box (I paid full price for a new CPU) and did not work in my system (it was defective on arrival) - it's a month later and I still have not received a refund.  I purchased an identical CPU from another source and that CPU booted up with no issues (it is running the PC I am typing this review on) so clearly an issue with the quality of the product that Amazon shipped to me.

While installation is easy, the chip may come with deficiencies that get worse over time.For the first couple months after install i would experience BSoD crashes and i was trying to diagnose. Now 2 months later the computer will no longer boot without BSoD. All other hardware has been replaced meaning the chip is absolutely the issue. Currently in the process of RMA negotiations with intel because diagnosis took longer than the amazon return window. So far their service has been slow to respond. Until intel admits to the faults in these generations and offers an actual fix i would suggest sticking to AMD.

Unfortunately this did not happen until the 30 day return policy elapsed.  At first I thought it was the motherboard or RAM.  But testing of different RAM ruled that out.  Bios updates to the motherboard did not help the issue.  Putting in a known good CPU allowed the final test of the motherboard and original system RAM and that all passed which indicates a issue with the CPU.

The amount of problems this CPU has caused me has cost me hundreds of hours of work. I've been building computers for over 20 years and this is by far the absolute worst component of all time. E cores will cause instability in almost every multithreaded application, clocking has to be severely limited to avoid blue screen of death, Intel Extreme Tuning Utility is borderline malware, and the high thread count is just deceptive marketing because 1/3 of the cores are laptop grade.

The instability seemed incurable so I returned everything and switched to the 7950x3d… and it just worked straight out of the box, runs so much cooler and less power draw, with no crashes.

The advertise that its goes up to 6000hz but that’s only on two cores of course and only when you don’t need them do they go that high. I had higher cinebench scores on my i9 13900kf then I did on this processor. It’s the same thing just overclocked out of the box. Save your money

i9 CPU Instability and Degradation - Buyer Beware",19-05-2024,"purchased the i9 CPU six months ago with high expectations for top-tier performance. Initially, it lived up to those expectations, running smoothly for about four months. However, my experience took a turn for the worse when instability issues began to plague my system.Games started crashing randomly to the desktop, and I encountered frustrating VRAM errors in Fortnite, which are known issues with 13th and 14th gen i9 CPUs. I soon realized that my motherboard's default settings were likely to blame, as they inadvertently cooked my CPU, causing it to degrade rapidly over a short period. Despite my efforts to disable overclocking features like ASUS Multicore Enhancement, the motherboard continued to apply overclocks, exacerbating the problem.In response to widespread complaints, Intel and motherboard manufacturers released BIOS updates touted to fix the issue by reducing power limits, known as the Intel Baseline Defaults profile. Initially, this seemed to restore stability to my system, but the respite was short-lived. After about a month, the same issues resurfaced, casting doubt on the effectiveness of the solution.I am currently dealing with Intel support over this CPU, and I have a case number with them as we work to resolve the ongoing issues. The fact that these issues are still ongoing and Intel is actively investigating the root cause speaks to the severity and complexity of the problem.Based on my experience and the prevalence of similar issues, I urge potential buyers to think carefully before investing in the i9 CPU. Considering the reported stability of i7 CPUs, it may be a safer choice for those prioritizing reliability."

Do NOT buy 14th Gen i9's",30-04-2024,"Hey all,I built my most recent rig with the following specs:CPU: i9-14900kMotherboard: MSI Carbon WiFi II Z-790RAM: 64 gig rip jaw low profile (certified compliant by MSI)Cooler: Dark Rock Pro 5GPU: ROG 4070Ti SuperPower Supply: Rog Thor 850w PlatinumCase: Corsair 4000DThis rig should be a monster, but because Intel has misled the general public, it is completely unstable and blue screens multiple times per day. These 14th-generation chips are trash. They are fraught with instability issues, and the news worsens as time progresses. We have been through three motherboards, three different sets of RAM, and two different GPUs, and the problems continue.Now, I have to decide if I can be without my rig for several weeks to try to RMA the chip via Intel. The worst part of all this is a crap shoot if I receive an actual working chip back. Again, it does not appear to be the chip itself but the instruction/algorithm Intel uses.Motherboard manufacturers are allowing these chips, by default, to run off the rails. Intel's power spec is 253W. When I checked the BIOS on my motherboard(s), they come by default set to run at just under 5000W! Are you kidding me? If you are not a really good problem solver with these things. I do not see the average consumer having any understanding of why their rig is acting like a crazy person.Anyway, just do yourselves a favor and take a big ol' pass on these chips. They are not worth it. Stick with your old chips until the next gen comes out or just switch over to AMD.@Intel; you have to stop being the Boeing of the Chip world. You were once a great company with high standards, and now you are just imping for your shareholders. Get it together, and start doing things right.

I originally purchased the i9 13900k, did no overclocking but had soooo much trouble with the system that I stupidly replaced the mainboard and video card.  I didn't refund as I assumed that I had done the damage.  Literally months of troubleshooting and doubled expenses before I realized that the asus mainboard defaulted to super high wattage and the chip itself began to degrade at an extremely fast rate.  Yet again assuming that I must have done something wrong I ordered this replacement chip, to find issues suddenly occuring again.  This is about when the news dropped on mainboard suppliers and intel passing the buck on an inherently co dependant series of faults that have personally cost thousands upon thousands of dollars.I'm an IT professional, have been in the industry for more than 20 years, and have never encountered a situation so costly for the end consumer.I really hate to say it, I hold stocks in intel, I've loved them as a brand and considered them to be a number one choice, I can no longer say this.I honestly think there should be a class action lawsuit over this chip and it's predecessorI had to purchase 2  rtx 4090 and 2 asus mainboards before I could even lock down this issue.I hate to say it but if I'd gone with a competitor I would have saved multiple thousands of dollars."

La incógnita de no saber que tanto estrés se le metió al procesador antes de enviarlo es complicada, cuando se esperaba un producto nuevo.Actualización: El procesador en efecto venía dañado, el primero problema fue que impedía la instalación de Windows. La forma de verificar la falla fue entrando a la BIOS y desactivando todos los cores, a posterior fui activando uno por uno. Con un solo núcleo permitió instalar Windows, el resumen fue: todos los E-cores funcionaban, de los P-Cores estaban dañados el 4, 6 y 7 ya que al encender cualquiera de esos tres desde la BIOS, generaba pantallas azules, se freezeaba o cerraba programas aleatoriamente.No descarto que el tema haya sido un problema de fábrica, pero desde que llegó con pasta térmica en los bordes, me hacía sospechar que había algo malo con el procesador, ya se realizó la solicitud de reembolso."

Poor Silicon Samples",22-04-2024,The one received was a silicon lottery loser that required excessive and abnormally high voltage and had horrible SP-ratings. It was returned because the poor silicon quality made it unsuitable for the purpose for which it was purchased. I purchased a 14900KF from Amazon to replace it and it was equally poor quality and had to go back. Intel needs to cull their trash samples and sell them at a lower price.

Possibly better memory support than i9-13900K",05-04-2024,"Once they came down in price, I did get a i9-14900K as an ""upgrade"" from a i9-13900KF to  i9-14900K .  It's OK but I can't rave over it.  It is more of an sideways change rather than an upgrade.The i9-14900K is fast but not more so that a i9-13900K.  For me, the Cinebench R23 scores are about the same for 13th versus 14th gen.  Though the i9-14900K appears to run DDR5 more stably and at higher frequencies than the i9-13900K.  Also, the i9-14900K is enabled for XTU AI enable tuning in XTU but it's not that helpful.  I even wonder if it is worth getting a K at all, these CPU's are plenty fast for gaming without overclocking.I did NOT notice a significant improvement in the operating temperatures.  Maybe a slight improvement but I did flush out the cooling system and clean out the water block so I am doubtful that the running temps are better.  Also, I suggest that you NOT let these chips get anywhere near TjMax (100C).  I had one i9-13900KF literally fail due to allowing it to get to TjMax frequently when stress testing.  A second one became slightly flaky.I thought the built in ARC display support of the K version might be helpful since I intended to devote the graphics card to the gaming monitor and use the built-in ARC on a side display.  But as it turns out, it wasn't worth it for me.  If you are gaming with this level of processor, you really need a comparable graphics card but most of them will drive four displays.  IMO, you are better off getting a KF and spending the money so saved on better graphics card.The original asking price was insane, I bought it on a whim on a late night.  On the morning morning after, I had buyers remorse, tried to cancel but could not, so instead, I refused the package.  It took literally 6 months to get a refund.  That was rather irksome."

Using an Asus mb, I had to go into bios limit voltage and manually tune each pcore. Temps were wild and out of control 100°c, clock speeds were low thermal throttling, random crashes, blue screens inability to run simple programs without them crashing and shutting down. Tried intel xtu auto overclocking, ai suite, and asus ai overclocking via bios.. none of that worked. Had to just dig into bios, set limits, and manually tune each core. Now system is stable and solid. Been benchmarking and stress testing for a few days now. Temps are great, and I am happy. Not sure if mb is culprit, gonna get another board and test the chip.

Thermal throttle spikes not present with 13900k",03-01-2024,"My 13900k never thermal throttled in any game, yet I'm getting thermal throttle spikes when playing games like Cyberpunk with the 14900k. My 360 AIO mount is not the issue, as temps hover around 90-93c when stress testing at 253w. I'm also using a contact frame. I'm thinking the issue might be the increased voltage at the stock 5.7 all core frequencies, because my power usage has increased a lot while gaming. Whatever the case, I'm not the only one seeing this behavior - it's unacceptable.Update: Reducing the e-cores to 4.3 helps significantly, and setting everything to 5.5/4.3 (13900k values) solves it completely. Simply too much voltage is being pumped into the chip at stock frequencies. I've set up a Thermal Velocity Boost profile where 80c drops to 5.6, and 90c drops to 5.5, with e-cores at 4.3... and the issues are basically gone. Ridiculous that this has to be done though."

Insane performance at a cost",02-06-2024,"This processor is a speed demon. Gaming, editing, encoding, and whatever else you can think of, it can handle. The performance is there. The value for money is quite good too. Unless you really want top of the line, this chip effectively eliminates the i9 from consideration. 20 cores. 8P and 12E. Boost up to 5.6GHz on 2 threads. I swapped a 12600K for this part and I'm still kinda staggered at just how fast it is in heavily threaded apps. This is a perfect upgrade chip for somebody on an older 12th gen i5 or lower. I wouldn't consider building new with it however.There's a cost to this CPU though. Heat. And power draw. I have an Arctic Liquid Freezer III 360 AIO on this chip, and even with a sizable undervolt, it still throttles at around 230W running 100C. It feels like this chip is almost uncoolable. Unless you go full custom liquid cooling or something. I considered a large air cooler for this chip and I'm glad I went with an AIO. Buyer beware. This thing runs hot. It's also incredibly fast. If you can cool it this thing will fly."

Main improvement is lower power cost day-day",03-05-2024,"I upgraded from an 8700k to this 14700k nearly 8 years later. Performance-wise, the difference is fairly negligible to me, and that is reflected in the 'real' specs. Going from 6 cores to 20 cores isnt really a 3x+ increase when most of those cores are 'efficiency cores'. User benchmark puts 14700k as only being 47% faster than the 8700k, despite being 8 years and 6 generations apart.The main improvement from my point of view is the reduced idle/casual power use. My UPS tells me that for my 8700k/1070ti system I drew ~0.43 Kw, and my new 14700k/4070ti super draws ~0.31 Kw watching YT, browsing the web (includes fans, monitors, etc).Mostly just wanted more balance for the new graphics card, since that's what does most of the heavy lifting these days anyway.

Fast, but unstable when overclocked.",11-01-2024,"I built 3 systems using 14900 series. They all had serious stability problems when in use.  After researching for weeks and reinstalling OS with no better result.  I finally disabled overclocking ""AI overclocking"", which was running as high as 1.6v.  I also found a BIOS setting after running some tools and set it INTEL FAIL SAFE.  this allowed me to run the AVX2 stress test successfully.  It basically throttles the chip.I can't tell you the frustration this caused figuring this out.  Everything from chrome browsers to Adobe CS would crash randomly for no apparent reason every few minutes while all ""tests"" showed it was fine.  I lowered my refresh rate to 60 from 120, killed AI overclocking and set the INTEL setting and now have a very stable system. It outperforms my 5950x when encoding, which is impressive.  It does run HOT even with water cooling.  IF I had it to do over again, I would avoid 13000 and 14000 chips as there is a OODLE issue as well when it comes to gaming with Unreal 5.  Basically an unfixable hardware flaw that affects some chips.Here's the thing, you will not notice a difference as nothing I use with the exception of HANDBRAKE, ever comes close to maxing out the chip when in use.  Adobe CS uses my 3080ti and the intel quicksync iGPU simultaneously which rarely went above 40%, and usually was around 15-20 when editing.  HW encodes for HD were at 350fps, software, 250, intel 300.  So a small advantage in Adobe CS is why I went with the 14900K vs KF.System was using ""AI overclocking"" pushing it to 6.2 roughly single core.  Disabled in BIOS now.Specs: Asus z290a Wifi II, Corsair 96GB DDR5 5600, Samsung 990 Pro, CPU Water cooled, 3080tiSo the ""K"" is basically useless for me at this point and don't see myself doing it manually as it's just not worth it to me.

All the description says is that ""Discrete graphics is required."" It would be much more helpful by adding a line that says the F version stands for no integrated graphics card. If you're doing any kind of workstation work such as video editing, most software will take advantage of the processor having an iGPU as well and so I'm actually losing performance with this model version.

A Monster CPU with One Major Caveat",20-10-2023,"I built PC with the new Intel i9-14900k, and I must say, it's a beast of a processor. Coming from an i7-8700k, the performance boost is nothing short of incredible. Multitasking, gaming, and content creation have all seen a significant improvement. Multithreaded applications and gaming experiences run smoother.  It's a productivity powerhouse. The clock speeds are no slouch either, making it excellent for single-threaded tasks and gaming. The major downside of this CPU is the heat it generates. Even with a high-end cooling solution, it tends to run hot, and that's something you must take into consideration when setting up your cooling solution. Be ready for this CPU to draw a significant amount of power at full load. It can put quite a load on your power supply and might necessitate an upgrade if you're not already prepared. The Intel i9-14900k is an incredible processor, and the upgrade from an i7-8700k is substantial. Its exceptional performance in various tasks justifies its price tag. If you're willing to address these challenges, you'll be rewarded with a fantastic computing experience."

Sometimes these things get hard to acquire, especially at a decent price.Seems to run a little hotter than my Ryzen 9 7950X, so I went with dual 420mm,  If you buy this CPU you should really consider custom loops or large cases with 420mm AIO support."

Intel has a long way to go.",21-10-2023,"To start, this is a great CPU. I consistently maintain 5.4-5.6 GHz without entering overclocking territory. I paired it with an MSI Suprim X 4070ti, and they destroy 1440p together. However, this is obviously a refresh and NOT a new generation. Performance gains are limited and to get there they raised TDP and thus it runs HOT. I have a 240mm AIO and its.. fine. It's just disappointing that this is how Intel responds to competition. This is a missed opportunity. A very good CPU but with both GPU and AMD CPU's getting leaps in generational performance this was disappointing."

Cool stock, hot with unlocked TDP limits",31-10-2023,"I love and hate this CPU. Out of the box with stock intel specs it runs cool on a 360mm AIO but really hardly any gains over a 13900k. This is not a new generation so intel should have done what they have done in the past and call this a 13990k or even 13970k like they did back in the Devils Canyon release (4790k upgraded from 4770k)on a 13900k if you unlock the TDP limits through features like Asus Multicore Enhancement (or manually remove the TDP limits) it basically performs within margin of error of the 14900k stock limits if not beats it on longer test when Intel limits are reached (10min loop of Cinebench R23 for example).If you unlock the limits of the 14900k you start getting thermal throttling with high core count benchmarks and then it actually can perform worse than the 13900k with unlocked limits because the 13900k will hold 5.5ghz but the 14900k will bounce between 5.2-5.6ghz.I had to set the power use limits to 320w in the BIOS to get it to reliably match or sometimes beat the 13900k with unlocked TDP limits.Where this CPU can shine is if you are into undervolting. I suspect there is some headroom there.If you are air cooling the CPU or even a 240mm AIO you probably need to keep this on the stock intel TDP limits and would be fine.To really get the most out of the 14900k I would say you need a custom loop, otherwise just get a 13900k and unlock the TDP limits with a 360mm AIO cooler. Still 4 stars because it is basically a 13900k. I would give the 13900k 5 stars.If the 14900k was much more expensive I would probably downgrade it to a 3 star CPU. They basically are asking for what the 13900k cost so it seems like a fair tradeoff."

6.2GHZ 8200mts cl38 Daily Driver.",04-04-2024,"This professional CPU isn't designed for the average user. However, if you're a tinkerer at heart, eager to dive deeper than the surface-level information often presented in YouTube ""videos"" (or should we say, commercials), this is unquestionably for you. I've acquired multiple units for various builds/configurations from a wide array of retailers—Best Buy, Newegg, and others included.For those considering making a purchase, I highly recommend using an Apex/Apex Encore MOBO or another reputable 2 DIMM board, particularly for AM5 or LGA1700, if overclocking is your goal. A high-quality cooler is crucial; for those opting for an AIO, ensure it includes at least an 8th gen Asetek pump and a 360 Thickboy copper radiator with performance fans—Avoid the aesthetically pleasing but functionally inferior Lian Li reversed SL Infinity Fans. Genuine static pressure fans, capable of efficiently doing the job, are what you need. Despite what your favorite YouTuber might suggest, you should prioritize efficiency over aesthetics.When selecting DDR5, opt for GOOD BINNED options. If a high-binned QVL compatible set isn't your choice, at a minimum, go for HYNIX A for single rank and HYNIX M for dual rank.The 14900K, when expertly tuned, becomes a gaming and multitasking powerhouse—achieving 43 to 44k in R23, with 6.2GHz boosting, 5.9GHz across its 8 physical cores and 8 threads, and 16 physical e-cores at 4.7GHz for a total of 32 threads, of which only 8 are virtual. With hyper-threading and e-cores enabled, it supports 8200 to 8400 MTS CL38 DDR5 RAM, boasts sub-55ns bus latency, and sub-9.3ns FWL. It's a marvel in Aida64 full, minus SSD, burn-in stress test stability. Adjusting all cores down to 5.8 and boosting to 6.0 can further reduce bus latency to easily below 50ns...Did I mention overall CPU temperatures typically remain between 35 to 40°C under heavy gaming loads, rarely exceeding 50°C? Despite the capability of 3 EATX connections to easily deliver over 400W of power, I'd advise against exceeding 325W daily, as the performance gains beyond this point are minimal without extreme overclocking and cooling methods—increased voltage requirements could significantly shorten the lifespan of your CPU. For tinkerers, this CPU is a dream come true.As of this date—4-4-2024: We anticipate future silicon manufacturing constraints will evolve, but that's a discussion for another time.The X3D Elephant in the room: Don't worry, I own one, and this is about science, not purchase bias...We'll sidestep intricate discussions about CLDO, FCLK, and MCLK concerns, and why the substantial L3 cache has become an essential workaround for the instability caused by chiplet-based IMC in handling DDR5 for gamers. If the augmentation of the L3 cache wasn't primarily to address DDR5 issues stemming from the chiplet design, why not significantly enhance and accelerate the L1 cache? The design doesn't allow for it since it's not monolithic, which wouldn't be practical. Those well-versed in the subject matter understand this. While chiplets represent the future, we must acknowledge that this future hasn't fully materialized for every aspect of computing, allowing us to look beyond the ""normie YouTuber AMD cults.""Indeed, I own a 7800X3D build and absolutely adore it! It excels in gaming... primarily in GAMING! Thus, there's no cause for concern. Let's briefly touch on the ""benefits"" like reduced thermals and supposed platform longevity (as if motherboard chipset upgrades and advancements in power delivery methods don't occur... humor me, over the planned 6 years). I, too, long for Z390 features on my Z790 board (/end sarcasm), not to mention the potential for longer boot times when tinkering with DDR5 or PBO, or even under normal conditions, and texture stutter/tearing... oops, and all those other delightful topics Lisa tends to highlight without addressing the influence of influencers with communications degrees rather than computer science degrees.  Just having fun, do what you love!I don't blame Amazon, Intel, AMD, or Nvidia more than the other. Manufacturing and shipping issues happen. The chip I received from Amazon didn't meet my expectations, but my other purchases have been exceptional. By chance alone, the other four 14900Ks I've received from various distributors have been stellar!Note:Settings in pictures are daily driven....No stability concerns all AIDIA 64 Stress tested for multiple hours and hundreds of gaming/workload hours.  I can get bus latency down to under 50NS but need to decrease core clock to locked 5.8GHZ to stay at safe voltage....

IF YOU WANT THE AIR COOLED OPTION",11-02-2024,"I'm not going to go over the same performance reviews others have done, yes its very fast for only $550 its the king of the poor mans build PC. my last PC its replacing was a $1000 10980xe and looking at the numbers the 14900k in average is 70-77% faster than the 10980xe. the only disadvantage between the 2 was the 10980xe had 48 PCIe lanes and ran 32c to 56c hot.i can't say the same about the 14900k heat, its spreader is almost half of the 10980xe. you can't just simply add a stock cooler or a ""MC'watercooler"" and expect the problem will solve itself. this is the first CPU in my 26 yrs of building PC's you have to plan out your cooler set up.ever since a 2012 water leak from these Mc'watercoolers (all in one 2 fan radiator kits sold by name brands) Ive never trusted them cost me $1500 in damages. The only water coolers that don't leak for me were the ones i built but water cooling is expensive and you have to inspect them at least every 3 months for debris in the tank or leaks. with air i only have to clean the pc 2x a year.yes you can control temps with an air cooler, and get the same temps as a 3 fan radiator water cooler. I'll post the results without adding a watt limit in the mobo post screen.here is the parts i bought to air cool running the new cinabench 2024 for 30 mins i can get max performance on a defualt non OC not hitting above 99C on the P cores1. Noctua NH-D15 chromax.Black | Dual-Tower CPU Cooler | 140mm | Black2. Noctua NF-A15 HS-PWM chromax.Black.swap (this adds a 3rd fan for the air cooler you'll need it)3.

Easycargo 40mm Heatsink Kit 40mmx40mmx20mm (this you place on the flat base of the noctua cooler will help dissipate heat)5. Easycargo 100pcs Heatsink Assortment Kit Small Cooler Aluminum Heat (these you throw on the back of your mobo on and around the mount brackets you'll me amazed how adding heat sinks on the back of the mobo will reduce temps)6. Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut (this is the best thermal grease cooler by 1-2c cooler than artic silver mx 6)7. Thermalright Intel 12th/13th Generation LGA1700 Anti-Bending Buckle ( a must add a little thermal grease on the cpu side flaps this buckle is 100% aluminum will al help dissipate heat.then i went to my mother board software options (mobo is an MSI MEG Z790 ACE MAX) select ""CPU cooler tuning"" select ""tower air cooling"" which will limit the wattage draw to under 300w also note if you are not using a Water Cooling Reservoir  you should also use this option, water cooling a 14900k and OC really does require a reservoir, and a 4x 120 fan size radiator if you're simply using a pre-built 2x fan radiator its not enough to handle the 14900k and the CPU is known for drawing 370w plus!!so using air cooled i got a 2371 score with no watt limiter option an temps were 78-100c on the p cores, and with the 300 watt limit the score was  2328 with temps 70-99c never hit 100c case the limiter would kick in. (note this is from CPU testing that punishes the CPU realistically i don't see this CPU going over 88c even on the most demanding game in 3 years.i personally do not recommend OC this CPU its already been pushed to its limits by INTEL at best for another 100 watts when all you're getting is 3-4 more FPS and that's not worth it. and all these people bragging a 6.2-6.5ghz OC, there just flexing for clout, then they take the CPU back to default. i already have my P cores spiking to 6.002 at 288-300 watts, and under 99c temps; adding 0.198mhz will meaning nothing for apps and gaming.personal note the MSI MEG Z790 ACE MAX Gaming Motherboard is absolutely amazing at squeezing out all the performance of the 14900k worth the $700 price never crashed during testing that 26 power phases is godly  compared to my last gen EVGA x299 dark had 12 phase...RIP EGA :("

i7-14700K is a significant improvement from i9-12900K",31-05-2024,"I decided the difference between the i7 and the i9 didn't justify the price difference, considering I was already getting about 1/3 more performance than my 12th generation i9. I wanted plenty of motherboard resources so I also bought the MSI MEG Z790 ACE, 32 GB of Kingston Fury 6400MT/s DDR5 and a 2TB Samsung 990 NVMe drive.Cooling had been a slight issue with the 12th generation i9, even with a 360mm AIO cooler, so I went custom loop. Along the way I found a GPU water cooler on sale and decided to install a lot of cooling. The Thermaltake 900 tower can take two 560mm radiators, but I wanted some disks, so I went for a 560x140 and a 280x140, both 45mm thick and backed by 6 fans. Four more fans feed air into the case and there's till plenty of clear space for more air to be dragged in.So what's the result? The processor runs at 85C worst case, and only two cores at that temperature. The fast DDR5 does make a significant difference. I initially ran it at 6GT/s then turned it up to 6.2 and finally 6.4. The last change is a 3.5% change in DDR5 speed and that gave me a 2.4% increase in system speed. I kept my old RTX3070 which used to run over 80C and now runs at 62C worst case. So despite more performance the system runs a lot cooler.I mostly run X-Plane 12, which runs the GPU and CPU very hard, continuously. After several hours the cooling water reached 36C and the worst core temperature was 85C. The processor just works. No stability issues with the standard settings on the MSI Z690 motherboard. There are three standard memory tuning options for 6.0, 6.2, and 6.4 GT/s and all work. This will do for me for a few years."

I want to delid it but I don't see the need and here is whyEven if I can get it 20 degrees cooler it will not matter It will still need 3.5 to 4.2 volts to stay stable at advertised speeds.I am running it @ 5.4 GHZ all P cores and this thing is unbelievably reliable . And maybe 10 seconds extra to render vs 5.7 to 6.0 GHZI get the point that ppl want to have the Bragging rights to say that it runs that fast but it will gwt damaged guaranteed 400 watts is a lot for that little unit. I think that 5.4 5.3 5.2 is more than enough specially when you have a total of 32 threads and gaming is practically single threaded . And most games are GPU bound. I only use it in the gaming department for Flight simulator and have not seen it above 68 degrees.I had a 4770 k and still running strong at 4.5 GHZ in a very small case.Intel is a beast and this I 9 is very good . Future proof for at least 5 years to come .Note. I have delided at least 20 cpus and the ones that got damaged were the ones that got a lot of voltage . They are very heat resistant but voltage just kills them .I have been running this cpu 24 /7 not an issueNot a blue screenJust underclock and undervolt and you are good to go This thing is a monster .

Much faster than my previous i7-6850k",19-03-2024,"So I finally upgraded my home workstation, and went to this new i9-14900K. It is incredibly fast. I had a Davinci Resolve video project file that I rendered on my old setup, the i7-6850K and it took just over 22 minutes to complete the render. On the new i9, the exact same file was re exported, took just over 8 minutes..! almost a 3x speed increase.! Also, when you speed up footage in Resolve, the old cpu could not play it back smoothly, it would jump and chug like crazy, the new i9, it plays it back sped up 800% no problems and I can actually see how it looks without having to export the entire video clip to see it playback the retimed footage smoothly. Applications open u p much faster too, but that could be more due to the pcie4.0 nvme system drive that is much faster than the previous version nvme I had in the old build. The one thing I do not like about the new cpu, is the number of pci lanes. You only get 20, 16 are pcie5.0 and 4 are pcie4.0. This wont be an issue for most people, but my old cpu had 40 lanes, allowing me to run 3 GPU's at the same time, and YES, I needed them, I use GPU rendering software that can use up to 8 GPU's in one system on one license and every additional GPU speeds up your render times a lot when rendering out 3D sims. With this new cpu, I can only run 2 GPU's and they run at 8x, cause they share the 16x, and that does leave me 4 full pcie4.0 lanes for the system drive. It is not a deal breaker, and the increased speed overall is well worth it. One thing EVERYBODY should be aware of, is these new intel chips have P cores and E cores. Something my old cpu did NOT have. E-cores can severely impact certain software performance. When I booted up the new machine and tried my Ableton DAW  for the first time, I was expecting to be so happy with a performance boost, and the software was literally almost unusable.! The E-cores were slowing the software down so bad, I could barely change settings in the preferences.! It was that bad. I had to install process lasso ( fantastic software that is free if you have never heard of it ) and disable the use of E-cores for Ableton and then it worked very fast and is great.!"

Great Performance!",05-04-2024,"Upgrading from a 10700KF to 14700K. Lots of forms posts are degrading this processor but I’m here to tell you it’s well worth the money! Just make sure to go to your BIOS and limit the power to 253W. The whole heat of this chip is blown out of proportion. I haven’t gotten heat issues while gaming.Overall I have this chip paired with a 3090, while I’ll wait for a new 50 series card.Some of the gains I’ve gotten at @1440P, 45 in ultra wide 21:9, max graphics settings:Overwatch: overall 50fps gain, consistent 240hz capped out for my monitor.Black Desert Online: overall 35-40 fps gains.These are the games I normally play a lot and it’s truly notice when upgrading to this chip. Overall the computer is a snappy and fast and haven’t notice any hiccups. Really great chip and planning on keeping this for the next 4-5 years."

While doing benchmarks, a few Pcores would hit 100c while others would hit 92c. Ecores was about 87c and low of 83c on 4.3Ghz all Pcore and 4.2Ghz all Ecore. Offset voltage was at 0.3. After switching back to auto clock, I still managed the same temps, but getting 5.1-5.2Ghz on Pcore and 4.3 on Ecore. If my case allowed 120mm fans, I would of most definitely installed 240mm AIO cooler. That for sure would of helped with the temps and get me higher benchmark numbers.When it came to rendering a 20 minute 4k video on sony Vegas Pro 18 (IGPU only), it took about 15 minutes to complete it vs my I9 9900k that would of taken over an hour to finish it (RTX 3060). This system was meant specifically VR/light video editing. So, considering how fast it is on the rendering without a dedicated GPU, I am pretty excited about it. I haven't tried the VR aspect yet.Overall, if you are coming from a few gen older CPU and want to upgrade to the 14900k, you wont be disappointed."

Scores well with cinebench",05-04-2024,Like the idea of no onboard video heating up the processor.  The irony is i have a Asus pro art MB 750 model that does the integration of components. My station is primarily used as a work station though it scores well with PC Mark 10 and cinebench. 3D Mark declares the obvious that I need to upgrade my video card from several years ago. The ai over clocking helps in the bench marking significantly. Lot easier to overclock than in the early 2000's on my core 2quad.

After upgrading from a Ryzen 3700x to this, my work speed, gaming, everything cannot lay a finger on this thing. The only time's i've seen this truly cap out is during extreme compression, decompression, and specific rendering situations. The only con which isn't truly a con is that this chip can get incredibly HOT. If you're going to get this? I would absolutely suggest a 360 AIO cooler or you're going to experience thermal throttling, or even thermal shutdowns.

Running air cooled on DeepCool Assassin IV with ease",03-11-2023,"So far so good.  This CPU is a monster and runs very nicely and boosts to max clocks (6ghz on two cores and 5.7ghz on all cores) unlimited TDP settings but thermally limited at 90c with -60mV offset.  I have noticed that it runs a bit cooler than my previous 13900KF, especially when you consider the core to core deltas.  I use my PC mostly for gaming and encoding, so as long as you have a great case with plenty of air flow and a top notch cooler, you can easily run it air cooled without issues as it will just throttle itself when it hits whatever thermal maximum you set in the UEFI BIOS.In gaming workloads it never throttles though and stays at 5.7ghz all core boost the entire time with temps in CPU intensive games anywhere from the upper 50s to mid 60s and upper 40s to mid 50s in non CPU intensive games**Update**I have the CPU now at 5.8ghz with HT disabled and a -75mV offset and it's working like a charm and very stable in gaming workloads and encoding (it downclocks when it hits 90c for encoding workloads but for gaming it stays at 5.8ghz), which is amazing since it's on an air cooled setup, though the setup is as optimal as it gets for air cooling!  As for temps, they are a little lower than running it at 5.7ghz with HT enabled and a -50mV offset.  If I use a -75mV offset with 5.8ghz and HT enabled, my PC crashes.  So disabling HT definitely enables the CPU to use less power.If you're predominantly using your machine for gaming, then I definitely recommend turning HT off regardless as most games tend to run better with HT disabled.  But if you're using it for productivity or a blend of both productivity and gaming, then definitely turn HT on.The only mildly disappointing thing for me is that the memory controller isn't as good as I thought it would be.  Mine runs 48GB DDR5 7400 CL34 at 1.35V on the IMC, but to hit DDR5 7600 CL36 with stability I need to increase the IMC voltage to 1.41V which just isn't worth it if you ask me for such a minor bump in performance.  My previous 13900KF could do 48GB DDR5 7800 at 1.36V on the IMC.Core wise though, the CPU is definitely superior to 13th gen."

It does get spicy when I'm rendering or doing some crazy multi tasking.Gaming seems fine, no issues.  I play all kinds of games, FPS, MMO's, survival, etc.  (Paired with a Gigabyte Gaming 4090 OC, Tforce 64 gigs 6000 M/T DDR5, samsung 990 pro NVME 2 tb x2, no OCing done by me.)I replaced a 5950x, which was having issues for some reason, just felt like it was getting slower and slower, thermal paste and heat were fine on it, never got over 60c with the beefier AIO I had on it.  Just took longer and longer to render things.  I guess I wore it out!I just think you'll want a good AIO, and/or a solid water cooling solution for this to really get the best out of it.  I'm not sure a air cooled option will do you any good, but hey I've been wrong many times, so there might be something that can handle the job.All in all, not bad, but it's not going to give you much performance boost over last gen, matter of fact I found out later 13700k beats it in a lot of tests, blargh!

So far so good.",22-10-2023,"Sorta came from a 13900k but I gave that to a relative after their x299/i9-7940x system began to have issues. He bought a z790 board and was amazed how far ahead the 13900k is in comparison an overclocked Skylake-X processor. He fixed the issue with the x299 system, but he decided to stay with Raptor Lake. All of which is okay by me because that old 13900k had no overclocking headroom, and I could only undervolt it by 5mv before it became unstable. I was going to buy another 13900k or maybe the ks version, but I decided to wait for the 14900k.The 14900k I got on the other hand has some overclocking headroom. I already set all P-cores to 5.8GHz, while keeping the double-core Turbo Boost at 6.0GHz. I also set the cache to 5.2Ghz and it's completely stable. I was not able to raise the multiplier at all with my 13900k. Just happy my 14900k isn't a lottery loser.While the clock of both the 13900ks and 14900k are the same, the 13900ks has a cherry picked memory controller. If you're looking to do a ton of RAM overclocking then the 13900ks may be the way to go.... but that's not to say if you'd get a 14900k with a good memory controller. Both my 13900k and 14900k work with DDR5-7200 RAM with XMP set, and no adjustments to the memory controller voltages.If you're buying the 14900k off the get-go and building a new system around it, then I recommend pairing it with a motherboard that has the BIOS Flashback feature."

Runs nice and cool",06-03-2024,"You really don’t need anything over an i5 nowadays for gaming. I used to be an i7 or i9 guy, but there isn’t a need for them for gaming only. Runs cool on air or with an AIO."

Very happy with 14900K, the reviews are misleading. It's feels way better then they say it performs.",04-11-2023,"This CPU is amazing. Feels like magic. I have it running in an Asrock PG Sonic 700 series, with 32GB GSkill DDR5 7200, and a Crucial T700 2TB PCIe 5.0 SSD and Cooler Master Masterliquid Atmos 360. Anytime u do anything, even click a icon the cpu jump up to 6Ghz. And for me stay under 30C Idle and under 70C Max Load. Never mind what temperatures it runs at, I can't get it to throttle. Seems like all of its power is available on demand all the time. And I'm basically computing in Real Time. The 13900K was fast, significantly faster then the 12900K, and this CPU even though on paper it doesnt look like they did much, and in benchmarks it looks close, it still feels like 15-20% faster the 13900K when your using it. I feel like it runs cooler then the 13900K, the 13900K was the hot chip. I don't know how they do it. Like I said it's like magic how it stays at 6GHz and stays so cool."

High TDP and Temperatures",02-12-2023,"A very powerful processor, but if it does not have good cooling, its functions will be limited. Currently it is working wonders together with the other components. But if they have a moderate cooling system, it is advisable to use the other brand of processors ""AMD"" that has half the temperatures, but with 10% to 20% less performance in some activities, and with the defects that come with not have an architecture that self-protects well or do not update its software often for better handling.Finally, I recommend the processor, only if you have a processor that does not meet current needs. My I7 6700k can do it all, but for some specific technologies, such as SSD Gen 4, peripherals with high-speed USB - C and others, it couldn't cope."

HIGHLY SUGGEST getting a 360 AIO or a custom water loop, and a CPU bracket if you are getting this CPU. It run's very hot getting a CPU bracket cut down my temps about 5-10 degrees.

Recommend no smaller than a 360 cooler, I went Artic due to the increased width of their radiator core. Top temp (tuned) 95c but will play most games in the 65c range. VR put a greater heat of 91c max but the flight sim was beautiful and smooth as can be with water takeoffs and landings. This was an upgrade to a 12700kf that I chose awaiting the 14 generation processors. I have this combined with a Nvidea 4080 on a MSI z690 board with 64gb ddr4.  Smooth gaming."

Michael Crawford,1,Died after a couple of weeks of use.,N/A,"I put together a gaming PC collecting parts over time as I had funds to purchase. Finally put it all together and it ran well for about 2 weeks and then I began having blue-screen crashes. Now it won't even complete a windows install on a clean drive without crashing. Tried two mother boards, 6 memory sticks, 3 NVMe drives, and two power supplies before being forced to realize the processor is causing my issue. I am now out of the quick return path grace period and must try to RMA through Amazon. If you buy one of these chips, or any part for that matter, use it right away in case it is a bad part.< Time Passes > It has been a number of months since I wrote the first part of this review and replaced this bad processor with a new identical one. That new processor has been working great and continues to run well."
Michael,1,Does not work at all,N/A,"Does not work. Fresh out the box and along with other brand new PC parts, after putting it together the motherboard keeps flashing the CPU debug lights. I am 100% certain I put the CPU in correctly(correct facing arrows) as well as having a compatible processor socket LGA1700. I’m wondering if a replacement is covered by my warranty as I would like to having a working PC as soon as possible."

florenta edwards,3,Don't buy if you're a first timer,N/A,"I'm a first time builder, and I'm working with this CPU, it overheat 3 times in bios when i first started out. Overheats on cinebench and some games that push it to about 40% CPU usage. There are work arounds but as a first time builder i would have preferred to not have to deal with that. Nevertheless, at least I've experienced dealing with a chip that runs very hot."
Sabina Shanji,4,Works great,N/A,Costs a lot and I do not recommend to anyone with a tight budget like £900 if you have a tight budget I suggest the ryzen 5 5600x but overall the cpu is great and it works perfectly fine with any game
Amazon カスタマー,4,１５年くらいぶりのインテル,N/A,インテルはスロット１以来になる。同価格帯ならAMDだと今でも思っている。ただCPUソケットがAM5に変わり慌ててAM4のMBを探したがどれも高いこと高いこと。またギガバイト社の上位のMBは米国からの輸入品しかないときた。そこで同社のMBを検索するとZ690でDDR4対応のMBが普通にほぼ半額だった。ならばAMDの5900Xと同程度と思い本製品の購入に至る。「CPUが反る」等の書き込みが多いので「例のアレ」を同時購入した。良い製品かどうかは組んでみなければわからない。楽しみにしている。

Ça marche bien mais ça chauffe sévère quand ça active le turbo, et si on tente de ventiler correctement la moindre pointe s'entend !"
Rex Iriarte,4,"Run dual displays smoothly without any hiccups, here are my notes…",N/A,"This item has been with me for a very short time.So I recently decided to upgrade my gaming rig, and after extensive research, I made the bold choice to order the Intel Core i7-12700K Gaming Desktop Processor with Integrated Graphics and 12 Cores. Let me tell you, this processor is the absolute best! With its 12 cores, it brings a whole new level of performance to my gaming experience. Whether I'm playing graphically demanding AAA titles or indulging in intense multitasking, this processor effortlessly handles it all. And what's even better is that it comes with integrated graphics, meaning I didn't have to shell out extra cash for a separate graphics card, yet. The integrated Graphics offer the flexibility of running dual displays smoothly without any hiccups. Plus, with Intel's reputation for reliable and high-quality products, I know I can trust the i7-12700K to last me for years to come.I hope you find this review helpful."
Jay,4,Undervolt your intel CPU!,N/A,"The morning after building and setting up windows, drivers, etc. The PC had blue screened because of temperatures, and after a reset and entering the BIOS I saw that the temperature was 89 degrees celsius. Thankfully, after some trial and error I was able to undervolt it and not have my CPU die. I'd suggest anyone who looks into getting an intel CPU to undervolt it!"
headbouncer,4,"great product, customer service not bad but not perfect",N/A,"the one i bought one year ago had instability. didn't know it was the CPU until it really started acting up. had to do a lot of tests with different component to finally be able to pinpoint the CPU. When i reached out to Intel, they Informed me about a policy about ''tray'' processor and ''boxed'' processor. basically a tray processor is sold in bulk and they don't cover warranty. As for Boxed processor, they are sold by certain compagny and cost usually more. Fortunatly, the one i got was a boxed one, but still Intel told me i had a ''tray'' processor. i had to go on their website and enter my product information and send them the proof that their website is saying i have a ''box'' processor. It was a bit unnerving, but at the en, they offered me the warranty and i'm supposed to receive a new one when they finish processing the one i sent them."
Sai,4,Money Value is there but 13600k is better,N/A,"It's pretty good value for money (as far as intel CPUs are concerned...) for a 12th gen CPU, but if you're looking for the BETTER value get the i5-13600K which outperforms it at pretty much the same cost while being a 13th gen CPU. The only real downside of the 13600k is that it generally requires a 13th gen compatible motherboard, otherwise you'll need to FLASH THE BIOS on a 12th gen compatible motherboard to update the motherboard for it to be able to read 13th gen CPU (I highly do not recommend doing this). I've tried it a few and it's such a big hassle (many potential issues...)that I recommend first time PC builders or part buyers to just save yourself a headache and buy a 13th gen CPU, along with a 13th gen compatible motherboard (don't buy 12th gen mobo) which obviously doesn't require flashing bios for the 13600k to be usable."
Kuadra,4,Good overall,N/A,"Not much to say about this cpu. It's Intel, and these are immortal. Still have the 3770K I got like 10 years ago, and an Extreme I got even earlier than that.So the main motive here is to let Amazon know that I HAVE received the item, but I don't know how to let them know so they can change the ""package left at mail"" to ""Already received""..."
Doplar,4,"Fast and powerful, graphics not great",N/A,"Bought this K to have graphics backup. The CPU is great the graphics not so much. Still I do not use the internal graphics as primary graphics for my PC, but only for the purpose of having temporary backup when needed. So for that purpose it works. The cost vs the KF is fairly negligible so for its primary purpose it is a very good CPU."

KEITH C.,4,Great performance,N/A,Cpu works great. Performance is unreal. Only complaint isn’t with the cpu itself but with delivery. Only reason for 4 stars is Packaging was TERRIBLE! Box was smooshed so bad I’m surprised it actually works
Carlo,4,Potente ma caldino,N/A,Volevo dare 5 stelle perché il processore è sulla carta eccellemte e anche dei benchmark. Mi risulta però che si ferma al. 90 percento come se avesse un incompatibilità con la mia asus z690 a gaming. Ancora non ho ben capito quindi do 4 stelle.Nonostante quwtso piccolo limite mi va il 40 percento di più rispetto a un 11 gen.Quindi soddisfatto.Temperature alte se non usate un raffreddamento a liquido.Io uso un corsair h100 che è molto potente.Valutate un raffreddamento a liquido per quetso processore
A-Hole,4,Did not come with a fan otherwise works.,N/A,Could not tell be the advert that it was just the cpu. Took more than a week to arrive
HK40,4,Got unlucky first chip,N/A,Got a bad one.  Worked like crazy trying to figure out the issue and on board video was working some but not always.  Sent it back and got another that works amazing. Water coolers don't have the correct spacer for this chip but I checked the website and got one for under 10.  So factor that into your water cooling cost.
Andre,4,Great CPU for gaming and multitasking,N/A,Great CPU so far. Only limiting this CPU at the moment is the early versions of Z690 motherboard software that might not be overclocking at optimal levels (using auto overclock). Make sure you have a good CPU cooler or a cooler designed for the LGA 1700. Currently the Gigabyte settings for overclocking (bios or windows app) is pushing the CPU above spec and will cause throttling. I am using a Corsair H150i Elite CAPELLIX 360mm.Amazon delivery was late even with paying for the express option at check out
keith murray,4,Takes a beating..,N/A,Gets the job done takes lots of stress..
ScrubbieBear,4,Very surprised at how good this actually is.,N/A,I’ve never been and mad or intel fanboy. I’ve always gone for that’s the best bang for your buck… or what performs the best at a reasonable price. For the first time sense Ryzen I’m surprised to say intel is cheaper and light years ahead of its competitors with the 12700k.
Jmet,4,Works great,N/A,Runs cool and runs all my games well. -1 star for the packaging only one side of it was padded
Gabriel Tremblay,4,AMD longtimer switch on Intel...is it supposed to look like this?,N/A,"The media could not be loaded.
                



the cpu seem fine ( no noticeable damage ) but for me that unboxing look very sketchy and low quality for a 600$CAD product"
Joseph B.,4,Good,N/A,Very good
D. Sroelov,5,works great,N/A,"the CPU works great and is super fast.  i didn't really want to pay for the latest and greatest, mainly because i have found that a 10% increase can add 50% to the price of the CPU.  one thing to watch out for, there is no cooling fan in this package, so you have to buy one.  you can get the CPU with a fan, but it's a different part number.  personally, even though it cost more to buy the fan separately, i believe the Noctua cooler i got will work much better than anything Intel provides."
Amazon Customer,5,Ridiculously fast,N/A,"I've had this overclocked at 5.0 GHz for a couple weeks now and it hasn't skipped a beat. I bought an MSI Z690 MPG Edge Motherboard to pair with this beast of a chip. Keep in mind, it does NOT come with a cooler so make sure you have a reputable thermal paste and a solid cooler to pair with this. I have a pre-filled watercooler (Corsair Hydro Series H115i Pro) which is giving me temps idle as low as 19°C (not joking, look at the picture). Under full load, I have yet to hit over 50°C even gaming at 1440p (2k resolution). If I'm being quite honest, this CPU is overkill for gaming. If you have the extra money, go for it. If not, a i5-12600k will be just as powerful for less money."
JCB,5,intel still proves to be a realible brand,N/A,I've bounced over years from AMD to INTEL and at one point settled back to INTEL.  I typically go for the i7 processors to get more life out of my systems (rather than i3 or i5 processors).  I have gotten many more years than thought out of systems and still show good usability even after 6 years.  The processor installs easily provided you have some knowledge in building computers.  No blue screening to report used with ASUS Z690M-Plus motherboard and G.SKILL memory.
Andre Furlanetto,5,Awesome CPU,N/A,"My last PC CPU was an intel 9700k and while gaming-wise the performance doesn't seem much higher. I obviously get a few more FPS, but it has not been so noticeable. I wouldn't be able to tell the difference on a blind test. However, this CPU is just amazing for every other task and overall I am happy with it.Paired with the Asus B660-I Gaming board and 32gb of DDR5 5200mhz RAM and I'm truly satisfied with my rig performance so far. There are no hiccups or anything else really holding the PC from absolutely crushing anything I throw at it."
Vixel,5,Best CPU thus far,N/A,"Many people can argue AMD this or AMD that, or Intel i9, but if you're wanting something to start off at the high-end level, I would highly recommend this CPU. Granted, you should get a good CPU cooler or a decent liquid cooler that will keep the CPU cold. Other than that, this offers great performance despite the cost."
PD,5,i7-12700K vs i5-13600K,N/A,"I was deciding between i7-12700k and the i5-13600k.Nearly identical performance on all benchmarks.There is a very slight edge to the i5-13600k in gaming performance.But, the i7-12700k runs a bit cooler and uses less load in gaming, saving you electricity.The i7-12700k is also faster in Photoshop.Overall, they are very similar in performance, but, since the i7-12700k is a bit less expensive, it offered a better value.But, you can't go wrong with either one."
BWasike,5,Luck of the draw,N/A,"Lost the silicon lottery. My CPU doesn't clock as high as advertised out of the box.

ちけ,5,性能、消費電力、価格、バランス良し！,N/A,ARMORED CORE VIの発表を機に10年ぶりにPCを組みたくなったので購入しましたが、発熱が高いのでDeepcool AK620のcpuクーラーと合わせて使いつつ、反り防止フレームも取り付けてゲーミングPCとして使っています。Star Citizenというゲームにだけは性能が若干足りないので、後々13世代以降のCPUに買い替えるかもしれません・・・が一般的な有名ゲームで遊ぶ分には快適に遊べています。i7-12700Kと悩みましたが性能と消費電力のバランスを考え無印にしました。（家の事情で冬は電力消費が大きいとブレーカーが落ちる可能性があるので・・・）他の方も書いていますがCPUクーラーと反り防止フレームは別途購入した方がいいですね。発熱と反りの対策が出来れば一般的なゲーム使用には満足できる製品ですので☆５にしました。

A superb piece of a processor",N/A,"No doubt, 12th gen Intel processors are a marvel of computing technology. Although there is a continuing tug of war between Intel and AMD in this regard. I personally chose Intel Core i7 (12700K) with inbuilt UHD graphics for my newly built desktop PC. For those, who don't want to use a separate and usually exorbitantly priced graphics cards, this processor is a very good alternative. It can handle most of the processing intensive rendering of Blender easily with its unlocked overclocking (obviously you have to use the supporting motherboard, i.e. presently available Z690 chipset motherboards). It can also smoothly handle almost all the tasks of Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop with no hiccups. Not to mention the support of 4K video with HDR if you are looking for some decent and the latest entertainment in your PC. I would suggest this 12th Gen i7 to those who want to use their PC for content creation purpose in the best possible way and also at the same time save some money (compared to 12th Gen i9, which would ideally be the best anyway, but costlier too). The price is still at a high level. Hopefully this comes down soon with the launch of Intel's 13th Gen processors!"

Running 12 cores, and 20 threads (4 e-cores i think) I thought, well, for the price, it should be okay?I was wrong...This cpu is a monster in my eyes. Running with 32GB of ram (ddr4) and matched with the RTX 4070 GPU being cooled by the Artic Liquid Freezer ii, there is nothing stopping this from performing to its max. I would recommend this piece of kit to anyone, starting out or continuing on with building computers for their ""high end"" gaming etc. I have not once seen this struggle."

Dr. Mungo,5,Unfassbare Performance - Preis/Leistung überragend,N/A,"Was Intel in der 12. Prozessorgeneration abliefert, ist fast unglaublich. Nachdem AMD in den letzten Jahren die Intel-Konkurrenz gnadenlos abgehängt hat, hat sich die Situation jetzt vollkommen geändert.Der i7-12700 (aktuell boxed ca. 350€) liefert sich ein Duell auf Augenhöhe mit dem AMD R9-5900X (aktuell boxed ca. 460€).Für die Technik-Enthusiasten kurz ein paar selbst ermittelte Cinebench-Werte (R23):R9-5900X: Single-Core 1581 Punkte / Multi-Core 22126 Punktei7-12700:  Single-Core 1902 Punkte / Multi-Core 22069 PunkteBeide Systeme laufen mit 32GB DDR4-3200-Speicher (CL16, 1.35V XMP-Profil), die CPUs ohne jegliche Übertaktung.

Antes de comprar, procure saber nos fóruns sobre essa questão, não importa qual cooler e pasta térmica use, ele vai esquentar muito. A única solução é fazer um ligeiro undervolt, ou diminuir o loadline calibration na BIOS. Me fez lembrar o i7-7700K que sofria do mesmo problema."

Jacob,5,The best CPU I've owned so far. Rivaling even the 5900X! Intel is killing the game as of now.,N/A,"I upgraded to this CPU after some HEAVY research, asking Reddit (Both Intel and AMD subreddits), weighing in money VS performance gained. I have used AMD since I was a teen and started building computers. The conclusion is this: It is an amazing CPU, runs faster and cooler than my Ryzen 7 1700. The price AND performance VS AMD (Also including a board) was better than if I had went with a Ryzen 7 5800X.Some background information: I wanted to upgrade after receiving an Amazon gift card (I have never ordered computer parts from Amazon though). I upgraded from a Ryzen 7 1700, with an ASUS x370-f board. I really wanted to upgrade, and was sad also that Windows 11 did not support my CPU! I will give it to Microsoft for this, as it made A LOT of people upgrade their entire computers, all for basically the same OS as of now with newer looks, and not much done under the hood (EXCEPT for 12th gen Intel, so good news there too). Sadly, my old board STILL doesn't support the Ryzen 7 5000 series, and only the 3000 series (They are working on a BIOS apparently for the 5000 series, because of people who were in my shoes). I first almost ordered the Ryzen 7 3800XT, for $400! After a couple hours of research, asking, and thinking about it... I cancelled that order (Thankfully) and thought ""Well, if I am going to spend this much on upgrading my CPU, I might as well go all in/spend a little more for something better, as this may be my last big upgrade in this regard for awhile."" I was then going to get the Ryzen 7 5800X with an Asus board. There lied a problem of price, I could not find a board AND get that CPU still within my budget (At-least not a board that wasn't worse than the one I had in ways). I mentioned I had posted on the AMD subreddit, and even they suggested I go Intel (Intel is just killing it as of now, hands down, although I am sure AMD will retaliate). I ended up getting the MSI Z690-A DDR4 (I wish I had the money for DDR5 RAM, I would have went with the DDR5 version as it was basically the same price). I had A LOT of second thoughts on this board though, as it just didn't seem ""Premium"" as the one I had (I am going to do a whole review on it after this. I'll save my Pros & Cons for there.) This CPU also auto-clocks itself up or down depending on the load (Saw it clock down to 1GHz, although not for long, for example if not much processing power is warranted, which makes sense and I wish everything did). So if idling, it will clock down and save power/heat/and therefore longevity is increased. I absolutely love this CPU coming from AMD. Anyways...If you have a Corsair H100I RGB Platinum or similar cooler already: The included 1200 screws work just fine with the 1700 socket and this CPU, even though you are supposed to get the 1700 kit/screws for this CPU (Which I did, but they are taking FOREVER to ship, so I googled, and someone said using the 1200 screws will work just fine). I get better temps. than my Ryzen 7 1700. I can even overclock EVEN MORE but have no need, and no point.TL:DRUpgraded from: Ryzen 7 1700, Asus Rog Strix x370-f gaming.Upgraded to: i7-12700K, MSI Z690-A DDR4.Parts kept: 4x8GB 32GB DDR4 CL16 3000MHz RAM (With XMP, D.O.C.P), RTX 2070. The RAM works great with this CPU as well, although it TECHNICALLY (Latency wise, runs at 2T on Intel instead of 1T on AMD) runs slower than when on AMD (AMD's infinity fabric) but obviously whatever Intel is doing makes up for that, and therefore my RAM either runs faster/the same)Pros: It is an amazing CPU for price VS performance. The i5-12600K is good as well (I almost just went with it), and you would be fine going with it for gaming (As even it still has more cores technically than the Ryzen 7 5800X, it also beats the 5800X even though THIS CPU is supposed to be its comparison rival brother.) This CPU has cool temps on my Corsair H100I RGB Platinum cooler, and the P&E core structure are REALLY cool and fun to watch when doing tasks/gaming. It shipped fast!Cons: Literally none with the CPU itself. Just with shipping - It shipped really fast! Was here in 2-3 days after purchasing on here. The biggest complaint I have is Amazon's shipping (SO BE AWARE OF THIS) I have never ordered computer parts from Amazon, and have always used New-egg. They just left the CPU in my mail-box, and if it weren't for me looking at my camera's, and looking out for this part, it would have sat in the mail-box all day. My mail-box sadly is not very weather proof as well, and if it had been raining... It wouldn't have been good. Although it did come in a big box around it. The CPU also was jarred loose and flopping around in the box (Not held into the front window).I hope this review helps people!"

Paul Chang,5,"stable, fast, and smooth.",N/A,"This is my first intel build coming from past AMD builds (Ryzen, FX, Athlon, Phenom). I am nowhere near a hardware engineer level to distinguish or feel the differences in performances but for the average gamer and turning on this CPU with instructions followed, this chip is very well to be worth it and confident to be future proof until at least 2026. I overclocked this via the motherboard/bios settings and it stays cool with a $30 fan cooler. (don't get a super cheap or small cpu cooler otherwise would risk overheating) Just follow installation instructions carefully the chip is delicate. windows experience rating is a 9.7 so that says it all. If you have the extra 50-60$ go with the i9 i should have done that. AMD seems to be all the hype but I see why Intel won't be going away anytime soon this is a solid chip."

Mark R M,5,No problems!,N/A,"At this time in the product life cycle, the 12th gen CPU is about half the cost of the 14th gen CPU.  It is more than fast enough for everything I do.  My major reason for upgrading was my old motherboard did not have TPM 2.0.  The CPU was easy to install, it is running between 36-37 degrees Celsius (though I admit I am not stressing it).  I am very happy with my purchase."
Steve,5,Great price to preformance curve.,N/A,This appears to be the best option for intel at this price range. Works as advertised.
Munsha Kaunga,5,A good product is worth recommending.,N/A,"This is a very good product, and there are no issues with its features and performance. The usage process is also very smooth, and there hasn't been any overheating so far."
Ishaye W.,5,top notch CPU,N/A,It's a top-of-the-line CPU that will last for a long time. There's nothing to dislike about it.it replaced a 12 year 3770K!
Ian*******,5,Intel Core i7-12700K Comment,N/A,"我特價時購買的，使用上沒有任何的問題，物超所值。I purchased it at a special price, and I haven't encountered any issues in terms of usage. It offers great value for the money."
Robert,5,Great for the price,N/A,If you're looking for an Intel cpu I would recommend this even though it is a couple years old now I belive its still the best intel cpu for gaming
Damiangox1,5,Todo bien,N/A,Excelente

Ya vere como se comporta cuando haga mi ensamble"
Jorge Arias,5,Good value,N/A,"Went from a 9400f to this was a big different on gaming, i finally get the fully potencial of my gpu"
Amazon Customer,5,AMAZING VALUE!,N/A,"Wow what an incredible black Friday deal. Seriously, $211 is well worth it for the performance. I also purchased the 12600k for $153 which is another unbeatable deal offered this year at amazon. If you managed to get your hands on either one of you made the right choice."
b,5,As Good as Specified!,N/A,This is a second purchase of core i7 12700. It works very well as expected.
JD,5,Intel has never let me down.,N/A,"I've installed a 10th gen 2x, 12th gen, and a 13th gen on my family's pc's. I've never had a problem."
Leo Rayas,5,A good sweet spot for an over clocker,N/A,"for my limited budget, I bought it, While the 12700K isn't the top of the line, at least for me, it was more affordable and very performant. I've had good success overclocking it and actually undervolting  it to reduce temperatures!"
Client12345,5,After 1 year is working perfectly,N/A,"Great CPU for multitasking, I don't know too much about CPU but this is great!"
E I,5,Prior 12700k took a crap on under a year,N/A,"So far so good, but then that's what I said about the last one...  I'll check back in a year on this and hope it outlasts my prior CPU.As for the last one... it's Intel dropping the ball with their QC it seems.  Had an IMC function poorly and finally give up the ghost and refuse to post with more than one memory module installed.  Couldn't run any XMP profiles, and swapping the processor solved it (not a Mobo issue).Just watch for funky behavior when you buy this gen, and return it if *anything* seems even *remotely* off."
Jeremy W.,5,It was Surprisingly Simple to Install.,N/A,"The heart of my PC build and wanted to have the ""K"" version with the Integrated Graphics... even though I was going to have a GPU anyways, it's a good backup if the GPU fails.Can't do a Pro and Con here as there is nothing much to report.It plays every game without bottlenecking my RTX 3070 and was a breeze to install (there is literally one way to install it. <You'd have to intentionally or forcibly install it wrong).Also, it runs surprisingly cool and doesn't act like an easy-bake oven in my Motherboard."
Son Doan,5,Good CPU performance,N/A,"I got the CPU on sale and I would say the performance is great, my application is running smoothly and does not come into any problem for a year now."
Anthony,5,so good,N/A,"this thing is a workhorse! ive got mine clocked to 5.0GHz and it runs like a dream, keep in mind this unit will require a water pump air coolers are not enough!"
torreon49,5,Great CPU,N/A,"Bought this for a new personal PC. My last was an i7 4790K build that got totaled out (crushed) during shipping. After building a new one on a z790i platform, the performance gain was stunning, completely night and day! I cannot say enough about this CPU, and would totally recommend this product!!"
Andrew W,5,Watch the price on this one,N/A,"The i7-12700K is in the top 5 for gaming CPUs right now. AMD is doing fairly well as of late but Intel has a solid performance lead with it's single core performance on newer generation chips.If you're on the fence and want a quick top 5 for overall gaming performance, it goes as follows:1. i9-13900k2. i7-13700k3. i9-12900k4. i5-13600k5. i7-12700kThis chip is no slouch though, it trades blows with the 13600K in some situations if overclocked but overclocking isn't really fair for comparison.In conclusion, if you're looking around this price point, check both this CPU and the 13600k. Pick whichever is cheaper. Higher end 12th gen Intel motherboards can be flashed in the BiOS to take 13th gen CPUs too, but do your research on those before going that route. This one will serve you well. :)"
Stephen,5,Works Great!,N/A,"It's been roughly 6-7 years since I last build my gaming computer. Upgrading to this has been more than significant. As of this writing, I hope you've done your research the I7-12700k's price point and its competition. For this price point, it may be the top dog.Some things to consider before purchasing:1) Make sure you are purchasing a LGA 1700 motherboard. I went with the DDR4 motherboard because DDR5 is still at its infancy. The DDR5 ram may not be the best option for your buck right now. You'll be fine with DDR4.2) This CPU does consume a lot more power compared to its predecessor. Double check if your PSU will be enough. There are online resources that will help you calculate your PSU. It's always good to have a little overhead.3) Make sure your heatsink has retrofit screws that's compatible with this motherboard. You can purchase them separately. If you have a heatsink that's very old (<2016), it's more than likely it may not be compatible.Good luck!"
Forrest Hodge,5,A better deal for most people vs. the i9,N/A,"I had been planning to hold off for Raptor Lake, but my Z370 mobo died, and I decided to go ahead and get an Alder Lake i7.  So far it's impressive.  It runs much cooler than my i9-9900k (mild OC) ( 59C-63C under a gaming load vs 75C+) but that could've been due to the my old AIO being in it's death throws for the past few months.  3DMark CPU score went up noticeably as well.  Overall, I'm pretty happy with it.  Haven't messed around with overclocking yet, but there doesn't seem to be as much headroom left as there used to be,  from what I've read 5.3 Ghz is about what you can expect.  The days of getting another 800Mhz - 1 Ghz+  over stock clocks out of a CPU are gone it seems."
Antoine,5,Great product,N/A,Great product
West Coast Dad,5,Team Blue!,N/A,"Have been on team Blue for years now and coming off a 7XXX i5, this is a huge upgrade! Haven't looked into overclocking but having a K processor futureproofs me for that!"
Luke Cervi,5,Legit,N/A,"Paired it with an ASUS MOBO and a Lian Li 360mm AIO.Runs cool, no performance issues, and no bottlenecks for the gaming i use it for."
Antonio Rodriguez,5,Best purchase I've made in years,N/A,"Bought this for my new upgraded setup, I decided to pick this processor to replace my old i7 4790K, although it was still running strong after many years it was starting to show signs of aging so I completely went from 4th gen to 12th gen, performance in gaming and business apps is really noticeable."
ava,5,Great CPU!,N/A,Because the 12-th CPU was cheap I decided to buy a 12700K. It's awesome.
Ricardo,5,Excelente rendimiento y buen upgrade,N/A,"Yo trabajo con edición y producción audiovisual, ha mejorado mucho el rendimiento de la PC, sin duda su velocidad base es una gran ventaja, no utilizo OC porque creo que a día de hoy no hay mucho beneficio y perfectamente con la velocidad base puede con las tareas multitasking con programas pesados.Muy buen procesador y definitivamente mejora la experiencia con los juegos, juego ocasionalmente titulos como: Battlefield, Valorant, Star Wars Battlefront, etc y no baja de 75fps a 1080p."
SpartonEZ,5,Such a good buy on sale!,N/A,I bought this for my 13 year old son for a PC gaming buildWhen this is on sale for 219.99 its a immediate buy!Such great performance for the price - It's out performing my i-9Buy it you wont be sorry!
Hakob Karapetyan,5,12700k,N/A,a brand new one has arrived everything is working well
Paul Luu,5,Blue Innovation,N/A,"This 12th Gen Unlocked CPU is amazing for a Gamer PC Build compared to the Ryzen 5000 Series. The new LGA 1700 boards have an added benefit compared to the aging AM4 boards. This CPU support PCIe 5.0 and DDR4 or DDR5 RAM. I like how efficient Intel designed it because the P cores are optimized for gaming while the efficient E cores deal with the background tasks. Make sure to buy a good AIO cooler because the CPU will run hot when there is lots of load! Please note a new Intel CPU will come with its Intel factory seal outside the box. Moreover, I ran the CPU under 6% when running Minecraft with raytracing."

Overpriced. Should be around 55-58 even with 18%GST.",N/A,Product is good Price is high wait for prices to go down dont buy overpriced products. It's gives seller more power over us.
mark stenning,1,Broken cpu,N/A,"Broken, just found out. Missed return window by 3 days"
わさっち,1,本当にヒドイですね,N/A,先日､自作PCを組み立てようと思って購入し某PCショップにて代理組み立て依頼をしたらCPUが壊れてるため使用できませんと言われたので返品しました！結局そこのお店でＣＰＵを改めて購入し解決！両親送ってくんじゃねーよ！ふざけんな！と思いました
ととやん,1,残念ながら低評価です、違うCPUが届きました。,N/A,"届いたのは12900KSでした,商品の評価ではありませんが、出荷時にご注意ください。"
Electrosoft,1,Unit was previously opened....,N/A,"I've put together a few systems and run some retail 12900k chips so far and the 12900k is by far an amazingly fast CPU.Unfortunately this one I ordered from Amazon came already opened. As soon as I opened the shipping box I could tell it had been opened before. The edge was uneven and the label crease was loose. I put my X-acto Knife down (which is what you need or something similar to open these as the label is there for a reason) and with just the gentlest of pressure the label peeled away from the center where someone oh so nicely had finely cut the label horizontal to make it easy to fold one side back over the other and with just a quick once over it looked almost normal.If I hadn't opened a few of them already with Intel's fancy new packaging I probably would not have noticed but the way the packaging normally is, it is VERY precise, tight, even lines and you will not be easily or gently opening it up with a simple light finger pry.My biggest fear was there wasn't going to be a CPU in there at all but luckily the right CPU was in there that matched the container batch but if something is sold as new I don't do open boxes.Make sure to check your packages before opening. The seal should be nice and tight and straight. The edges of the back flap should be firm and secure against the other flap and the bottom line/edges should be even and exacting.Give a gentle pull on each corner of the box where the label keeps it sealed to make sure it hasn't been altered or tampered with. It should be VERY firm and unable to just pull open easily. Look at the condition of the box itself around that area and even the gold disk inside.Fresh, brand new i9 12900k's are very pristine and boxed with precision.Still, they are fantastic processors overall and a worthy upgrade from 10th and 11th gen."
Vinyl Friend,1,This generation needs alot of software and driver updates - SLOWER,N/A,"Upgraded from a i9-9900k. Using windows 11 I can absolutely say this system is soooo much slower. I work in Adobe programs. Their responsiveness and general speed is so painful. I'm considering going back to my old rig, or going back to window 10. have 64gb RAM + RTX 3090 + 980 NVME 512gb in RAID0. Never has having the latest felt like a significant step back."
Tony,1,No video,N/A,As other mentioned there was something off with these chips.This was a new build.I have no video - i've swapped RAM and the motherboardI get no errors on the mother board - there are lite for errorsNO GO - far too much time and money wasted of this - I am returning the processor and ordering elsewhere
mark manning,1,SCAM,N/A,i purchased this item then waited about a week for it.  when it got here it was ***NOT*** the item i purchased but a lobotomized version of it with no integrated graphics.  I purchased the advertised item SPECIFICALLY because it had integrated graphics.  the item i received requires discrete graphics.ABSOLUTE BS and UTTERLY unacceptable.
Henry,1,Overheats,N/A,If you get this processor it has high temps problems if you look it up you see online that it cant handle top of the line liquid coolers bought intel i9-12900ks works like a champ no high temp problems the best one out there!
Alex,1,Be Cautious,N/A,"Received the product, everything on the packaging said i9-12900k. But the processor inside the case was a celeron G6900.. Make sure you check the chip that you receive when purchasing."

Damien,1,Image mensongère et qualité dubitative du vendeur.,N/A,"Sur le papier, c'est un très bon CPU que je recommande à quiconque.Cependant, en l'ayant acheté à ce vendeur, je n'ai que des problèmes depuis que je l'ai reçu.L'emballage n'était pas la boîte bleue que vous voyez sur les photos mais un emballage carton avec de la mousse, probablement fournit par amazon, avec juste le CPU à l'intérieur, en contact direct de la mousse.Pas de suite mais un peu après son installation (après la période de garantie, comme par hasard), le CPU est maintenant quasiment inutilisable, puisque l'ordinateur est constamment à 100% d'utilisation de celui-ci, ou bien fonctionne correctement avec des pics à 100%.Pire encore, jouer à des jeux est un supplice, puisque le pc va tout simplement freeze et crash quand il le souhaite, avec en cause ce foutu CPU.Si vous souhaitez à tout prix acheter ce CPU, ne le faites pas ici, passez par un véritable vendeur avec un suivi et une garantie, ou bien vous allez jeter des centaines d'euro par la fenêtre."

tom,1,high price with bad warranty service and bad quality,N/A,"It does not worth buying this CPU. It is really expensive. I would expect it to be a good performance and good quality CPU and has good service, but it doesn't match my expectations. It is broken 10 days after I used it. My computer was certainly not able to open. After I google the issues and take it to a computer store, it seems like the CPU is broken and there are many defective merchandises in this product. So far, I am not happy but still can convince myself that I am just not lucky even I feel ridiculous about why such expensive items have so many defective products. I tried to use the warranty to get a new one or fix it, but Intel's customer service is ridiculous slow. After we tell them the issue, it has been a month and they are still verifying our information. it took them 4 days to reply us and told us what info they need. We sent them the information immediately. It took another 4 days to tell us that one of the information is wrong. We gave them the correct information immediately. This time, it took 10 days to tell us that purchase information is good, but they need the account holder to authorize the warranty  (why do not you tell us this at beginning?). After this, it has been several days and we still wait for the reply now. I do not understand why it takes so many days to just verify the customer information. Should not this be done in 1 days or even 1 hour? I understand it takes time to reply and communicate cross teams, but it still takes too long time. Especially, this is a high price item, it should have proper quality and service for this price."
Shopper,1,Good processor but must have gotten a bad one,N/A,I have a Gigabyte z490 arorus motherboard. Its supports nvme pcie gen 4 and pcie 16x with 11th gen intel. I got this because the 10700k was bottlenecking my gpu. Swap was easy but as soon as the pc went under full load it blue screened. Would not boot until i put the 10700k back in. Immediately returned

xx78xx,1,Not what it seems..,N/A,I'm getting BSOD's. Will not accept XMP profile. Just to run at stock the processor needs 1.7v? I ran 3D Mark cpu test cpu hit 109c!!!! At stock settings! This listing is deceiving. Did not come in the box. This cpu is an OEM tray processor with no warranty. The cpu displays very odd frequencies. I feel scammed! I'm returning it. I wish Amazon.com Had better monitoring of what and how sellers are listing products.
Marcus,1,"Runs too hot, no rendering power  - not worth the money",N/A,"Buy a LGA1700 series motherboard and put an i5 13600k 👌 approx same money, better deal! Make sure to get an upgraded cooler/fan!"
burlybilly,1,Expensive Garbage - DONT BUY,N/A,"This processor caused nothing but headaches from day 1. I spent weeks troubleshooting issues with my new PC, drivers, BIOS updating and tweaking, hardware changes, but nothing would get the PC working correctly.I finally swapped in a different processor and like magic everything started working correctly.What a hot piece of trash. Save your money and go with an AMD system.Luckily Amazon is somewhat honoring a return but I'm still losing $80.00 because I wanted to buy a ""nicer"" processor. Serves me right I guess. I'll likely just sell my system as ""new/refurb"" to get my money back and buy an AMD system instead."

It couldn't boot the computer. I tested with multiple motherboards and another processor so I can confirm 100%. The processor was returned but the seller charged me $150 restacking fee, which is really bad.It wasn't my fault and in fact, I had to struggle so much extra to test with buying another new processor and motherboard first to test this and go through the multiple cycles.Poor customer service, lost $150."

It did perform well while it was working but for a cpu that was not overclocked or used for anything more than gaming it shouldn't go bad like this."
Amazon Customer,3,It is used because you cannot get them new apparently.,N/A,"I was sent a lose used possessor in a box. Annoyed, but no choice apparently."
Jay,3,Intel jumps the shark,N/A,"Good for gaming. Definitely runs hot, even a 360mm AIO can’t keep it cool with ABT enabled. Frequently hits 100C when stress testing with ABT on AVX loads. During gaming with ABT with a 350mm AIO 50-70C. Also has an issue that the cores report 0C when in C states. Intel says there’s a “fix” coming but there’s no official timeline."
Amazon Customer,3,Definitely a downgrade from 10th gen {I9-10900k},N/A,"A noticeable lack in performance from my previous i9-10900k, but all in al it is a great CPU, just would recommend a 9th or 10th gen if you're looking for one"
William Durham,3,"Great processor, warm though",N/A,"Runs excellent, make sure you have sufficient cooling and watch your vcore, I've seen 1.6 vcore which is extremely high"

Joel Orellana,4,Instalación,N/A,Bueno al momento de instalar si tenía un poco de miedo pero bueno todo salió bien hay que seguir probándolo para ver qué tal va
Garrett,4,"Works great so far, maybe pre owned??",N/A,"Came packaged kinda poorly, and didn’t include the golden coin case, which makes me think maybe it was pre owned. When I opened the packaging though it had no paste on it and the pins looked brand new, so maybe they just don’t include it anymore since it isn’t the newest flag ship??"
Aaron,4,So many cores to use!,N/A,"I bought this instead of the 12th gen i7 anticipating future demand for more cores. There is a price difference to consider. As many know, more cores doesn't necessarily mean better. Games only use a max of 6 cores, though it may vary from game to game. If you just want to game, buy the i7 series. My 4790k had served me so well, it's still my backup on my old mobo. It's been at least 5 years since I bought ol' reliable. She's been through rough seas. It was time for her to rest easy.For the i9, in terms of gaming performance, only CPU heavy games like RTS games will see any benefit. Multi-tasking also sees benefit, though that's limited to the hard drive it's working off of. Still, I expect great things in the far future.The packaging is a keeper to be sure, too."
Fuzz,4,Not worth it over the 12700k IMHO,N/A,"The 12900k can be hard to justify. The 12700k is around two-thirds the cost and the difference in performance is only a few percent. Furthermore, you can get away with a moderate cooling solution on the 12700k whereas the 12900k really requires a top of the line cooler which will set you back even more. Even while using the NH-D15 CPU cooler I decided to underclock the 12900k a little bit in order to keep thermals in check, bringing the performance nearer to the 12700k. Given the option to do it over, I would have just gone with a 12700k and saved myself about $250."
moddywashere,4,Just about the best gaming chip you don't need!,N/A,"Aside from the nightmare Alder Lake is with ram clocking, this thing does everything you need to. Consistently hits 5.1 - 5.2ghz when needed.Don't listen to the AMD fanboys who try to slander this chip for its heating. I literally just have a 240mm AIO and it doesn't go above 78° and when gaming never even touches 70°. Just do 5 seconds of research on a half decent air cooler or AIO and you're fine with temps"

Paul Balan,4,Only worth on sale,N/A,"The tenth gen i9 is better than this one, but I got it because my mobo needed it for the m.2 slot to work. That being said, we're talking about small performance differences in top of the line components, so it's not a big deal. With this thing being $650 without a sale I would never buy it because I can get an i7 from the same gen or previous and it will be just as good. I will say that the photo is deceptive, it does not come in the package on the photo with the cool blue plastic box. It will come in a cardboard box like any other CPU. Overall it's still a great CPU and is a great upgrade from my previous i5 8600k, but not the absolute best and not worth paying $600 for."
Jefffahfah,4,Excellent value if it were priced lower,N/A,"The 11th gen flagship i9 was a major step backwards in specs.  CPUs with 8 cores and 16 threads have recently been reserved for i7 SKUs.  Intel last-minute scaled this CPU back because of constraints with the older 14nm process.At launch, this CPU was a terrible value.  As of now, if you shop around you can find this CPU bundled with a Z590 motherboard at a very fair price.  I got into mine for under $410.00 with an ITX motherboard.  This suddenly changes the 11900K to being an excellent value.  It works extremely well but remember that 12th and 13th gen Intel i7/i9 will blow this out of the water."
James P.,4,A little disappointed in the packaging.,N/A,"CPU is great. Not a bad deal if you are building a budget oriented high end PC. Performance is similar to the 10900k but has the PCIe gen 4 support which is the only justification for this CPU existance. This with a new z590 and depending if you already have DDR4 ram, this is 1/3 the cost of a new 12th existence.I will admit I am very disappointed in the box. The nice fancy one pictured is not the one sent. Instead you will receive your processor in a small cardboard box with Intel branding. It should be make clear that the box in the picture will not be arriving in the description or by updating the imgages."

Shawn,5,Great Processor But Can Run Hot Unless Tuned!,N/A,"Upgraded from a 9900k and had a hotter running PC. Couldn't figure it out at first and found myself checking my AIO, reapplying thermal paste, checking settings, etc.  After research I was able to discover that given it a slight undervolt helps. What ended up helping even better and easier was ticking down the performance in the Performance Menu.In those option by simply ticking down the processor to 99% my temps went down to 55 for most of my games from initially running at average 80-85.  This tuning comes without a noticeable hit on FPS except while playing ""Squad"" (a single core use cpu intensive game).  With that game I do lose at least 10 fps by having the processor at 99%.  This is not that big of a deal as I can easily tick it up to 100% for Squad and just put up with the 75-80 temps!Happy that I can at least play most of my games at a good temp while gaining good performance by this upgrade!"
Mike,5,Huge upgrade,N/A,"The Intel Core i9-11900K Desktop Processor is a powerhouse. With 8 cores and speeds up to 5.3 GHz, it's a beast for any task.

Amazon Customer,5,Problems after installing cpu,N/A,"Since installing this pcu I have been struggling with system stability. Not pinned the fault down yet, so it maybe a faulty cpu.It could be another device causing the issue of “watchdog code errors”UpdateThe problem was my graphics card, for some reason it needed to move to a different slot, the system is now stable. I also reconfigured the cooling fans to provide better air flow. This cpu can run very warm when over clocking, although with no over clocking benchmark tests still rates this pcu very high."

DUMONT Sebastien,5,Parfait,N/A,Produit parfait fonctionne au top
mlm,5,Still a great gaming CPU even after 3 generations.,N/A,"This was Intel's top line CPU in the 11th generation; it used the LGA-1200 socket which was only minimally different from the LGA-1151 socket (1200 pins vs. 1151 pins).  The motherboards for the LGA-1200 required only small changes in production spec, and the coolers made for the 1151 chips work perfectly on the LGA-1200.  By contrast, the 12th generation, using the LGA-1700 socket, required an extensive redesign of motherboards, and the coolers that got adapted over from the LGA 1151/1200 didn't really work properly on the 12th and 13 generation Intel CPUs.  This i9-11900K will pull about 170 watts through the socket at factory overclock 100%, and that's right on the limit of safe operation for the vast majority of air or liquid coolers on the market today."

Tom Sunday,5,A Catch-Up Review from a 2022 i9-11900K Purchase,N/A,"I am not a gamer by a long shot, but wanted a powerful Intel based CPU riding on an 'Asus Maximus Extreme Motherboard' along with a Asus RTX 4090 GPU. I purchased (1) of the most graphic intensive AAA game titles and a few CPU intensive military strategy simulation games known for their heavy demand for CPU physics computations. My Core i9-11900K which I purchased in 2022  performed admirably well on all accounts. Absolutely no complaints. Some reports say that the i9-11900K runs hot and sometimes above the 100°C mark? But that was not really the case with me or the many others when they installed a high quality 360mm or above sized AIO water cooler. My very demanding combat simulation (Command: Modern Operations) never presented a heating issue with the i9-11900K and with my over 80-hours of heavy duty play. For good measure my Cosmos C700M EATX case also includes a total of (7) additional  independent Noctua cooling fans, which of course benefits the cooling within the massive interior of the enclosure. Overall I am extremely satisfied with INTEL in general and recommend the i9-11900K and or its newer siblings now as a very good buy!"
Jin Seo Yun,5,Amazing product,N/A,"amazing product, and the shipping was excellent, however the box in the image isnt what you get in person, its just the standard box you usually get."
Mark E. Rowland,5,A really good value from Intel for Intel based motherboards. It is capable of overclocking.,N/A,This LGA 1200 cpu is robust and easy to overclock assuming your motherboard supports overclocking and your cpu cooler supports it. The base 3.5 GHz can easily support overclocking to 5GHz. I used the Intel Windows overclocking program and it was easy to do. The cpu installs easily and runs well.
Alexandre Mayrand,5,Super cpu,N/A,"J'ai enfin changer mon 6700k , jusqu'à maintenant je l'adore, avec un bon cooling il est super stable ! J'ai rien de négatif à dire"
Joe Fairchild,5,i9 11900K to the rescue,N/A,"I had an i7 10700 that went kaput on me, so I figured, why not upgrade to the overclockable 11900K, since it was only about 50 bucks more to the the fastest CPU my mobo can handle. I did install water cooling because it does run warm, but let’s just say this. My computer now works at warp 9.975. With the i9 10900k, a Nvidia 3060/12gb, and 128 GB DDR4 at 3200mhz, on userbenchmark website the lowest score I got was a 104% for gaming (UFO ranking). I overclock it a lot and it holds up well, and stays under 50c with the water cooling for me.11/10, would recommend, promote ahead of peers."

Burn0u7,5,Great CPU,N/A,"when i upgraded my desktop i decided to go intel core i9 this time. all my previous build was a 6th generation core i7 6700k. it ran fine but it wasnt up to running windows 11. so an upgrade was in order. besides, my old board was starting to fail. i originally bought a 10th generation core i9 10 core but that cpu  was junk. there wasnt enough PCI-e Lanes to support my drives and usb devices. this is a limitation of 10th generation CPUs not a limitation on the board. my video card (RTX 3070) took up most of the available PCI-e lanes which took out most of my drives. so i went to the 11th generation i9 8 core instead. very happy with it. it solved all my PCI-e lane issues. i am able to run all my devices and drives. the cpu clocks at 5.3ghz stable i have water cooling installed. i see zero problems with this chip. its fast, its stable im plenty happy with the upgrade. the board is a MSI MEG z590 ACE Gold. i have 64gb DDR4 3200."

This is the newest of the new guys, if you get this cpu do it proper, if youre not gonna shoot for utilizing its capabilities then get a 10th gen and save money. Youre gonna need a new board, water cool this thing, gen 4 nvme drive, new 30 series gpu's (cause they utilize gen 4 pci-e slots) heres a simple breakdown of a good starting point when getting this cpu:Step 1: get an 11th gen processor (this i9 if its in your budget)Step 2: get a motherboard with gen 4 pcie slots (z590-e was my go to)Step 3: obviously water cool this unlocked beauty cause it'd be a shame not to get it to 5.3ghz (done safely with corsair's H150i elite capellix; hovers around 40's in degrees Celsius)Step 4: get a gen 4 nvme solid slate drive (might as well go samsung 980 pro for the 7000mb/s reads)Step 5: enjoy windows booting and being able to start opening webpages and games within 5 seconds of pressing the power button and never waiting for anything to load ever again 🙌🙏⚡ This is the future ⚡"

William Snyder,5,Might be a defective CPU but dang this thing makes heat..,N/A,The seller did an amazing job.The item came even sooner than expected.The bad news is that I installed it in my previously flawless running machine. The reason I upgraded from my current i910900k is that I wanted to enable the NVME.2 4.0 on my SSD. I already had the drive and a Z590 motherboard so why not right? I put the new i9 11900k In and it started and enabled the 4.0 on my NVME. Yay right! Literally with in a couple minutes I received a watchdog timeout error. (This is caused by CPU cores failing to communicate with each other.)I called Intel tech support who was less than help full. I updated all drivers and still didn't work.I did notice my CPU temp was running over 100c. Odd because I have the best nactura CPU cooler they sell. I decided to upgrade to a liquid CPU cooler and that brought my CPU temp down to around 85c.That still didn't fix the time out errors. I put my old CPU back and all is happy. I ended up sending the i9 11900k back but at least my i9 10900k is nice and cool even at 45% overclock. LOL
Randal R.,5,"Product is as ordered, shipping was bad.",N/A,"Products operates as expected, but they shipped this really oddly. It was first shipped ups, and stayed in a picked up status for 2 days. Then a day or so later, delivered to usps. Sat in Des Moines IA for 4 days. Then it crawled to me well after predicted time. Don't ship this way. Its the worst way too ship. Also you shipped it in a Thin bubble wrap bag. Should have been in a box. Its a fragile chip, but thank you for a good working product with no issues as of yet."
Hectord,5,Surprising level of performance; use a liquid cooler for best performance.,N/A,"I purchased this CPU during one of Amazon's infrequent and short-lived major price reductions. I paid $301.99 for the CPU at the time when it was selling for $389.99.  I wanted PCIe 4.0 and Thunderbolt 4.0 and I was considering a 5900X but I found the AMD X570 motherboard feature sets to be disappointing even at the high end. Anyway, I usually buy Intel Processors although I've occasionally bought AMD in the past.  I have a very good Cooler Master MasterLiquid ML360 CPU Liquid Cooler which keeps the temperatures reasonably cool.  I also bought an ASUS Z590 MAXIMUS XIII HERO motherboard, everything is faster with this CPU and motherboard, from storage to graphics."
Ken K.,5,Is what it is.,N/A,"As others stated it is not in the box being shown, so the advertised product is not what you get.However the good thing is the box doesnt mean squat to how it runs.Just grabbed this to upgrade my system from a 10th gen i9 to this, only difference really is faster pcie slots on my board (this would depend on your board) and opens up an additional nvme drive."
Kyle L.,5,"Overkill, even for flight simulation",N/A,"Having eight cores and hyperthreading makes for a very powerful processor. This is a very good ""overkill"" processor; that is to say, if you get this you'll outpace software for several years. It also has onboard graphics, so if you're buying this for rendering and just light computing, you'll be okay and won't have to buy a discrete graphics card like a GeForce.That said, this thing can sometimes get warm under heavy use, so a cooler is recommended. I use a liquid cooler, but if you're not using it for heavy gaming, you can get away with just a fan.Overall, 10/10."

David Ginsberg,5,Great cpu for the $300 i paid for,N/A,So far I’m really liking this cpu. I purchased it on prime day for $300 which imo isn’t too bad compared to what it used to be and how expensive the 12 gen cpus are.Paired it with the z590 asus strix E that i got for $200 on prime days. It’s working out pretty well.Also threw in the 3600 cl16 ram with it as this ram apparently runs well with it.Overall I’m pretty happy with this purchase
Anthony Ross,5,Quiet and Cool,N/A,Installed the i9 11900k in the ASUS Prime Z590-P WiFi6 with Team group DDR4 3200 CL14 and ASUS RTX 2070 has this computer running less than a whisper of sound I mean even when the PC ramps up to 5.3GHz then you hear still a whisper from all fans you really need to pay attention to the PC to even notice any sound at all.

I recently got my hands on the Intel Core i9-12900K Desktop Processor, and I have to say, I am blown away by its performance. This processor is an absolute powerhouse, with 16 cores (8P+8E) and speeds of up to 5.2 GHz. It's also unlocked, which means I can push its limits even further if I want to.Installing the processor was easy enough, although I did have to make sure my motherboard was compatible with the LGA1700 socket and 600 series chipset. Once I had everything set up, I fired up my favorite games and applications to see how the processor would perform.The results were nothing short of impressive. The i9-12900K chewed through every task I threw at it with ease, from demanding video editing software to the latest AAA games. I was able to multitask without any lag or slowdowns, and my system felt incredibly responsive and snappy.The processor also runs surprisingly cool, even under heavy load. I did notice a slight increase in power consumption compared to my old processor, but it's a small price to pay for the sheer performance boost.Overall, I am extremely satisfied with the Intel Core i9-12900K Desktop Processor. If you're a power user or a gamer who demands the best performance, this processor is definitely worth considering. It's not cheap, but in my opinion, it's worth every penny for the sheer power and speed it delivers."
YMS,5,all wat I needed for the next coming 5 years,N/A,"I purchase this CPU 1 year ago and it cost me 74,000 JPY back then.the price didn't drop much since that time and the performance is satisfying so far.the new generation spec is higher so if you want to buy this CPU don't. instead, you can buy i7 Gen13 as it will have the same spec plus a better cache than the 12 Gen.it might be better to buy the K version in case you have issues with your GPU to troubleshoot."
Fausto,5,OTTIMO,N/A,"Processore veramente ottimo in tutte le su parti.  Ottimo il venditore che ha spedito il processore ben 10 giorni prima della scadenza prevista. I processore è arrivato nella sua confezione originale , perfettamente sigillata, cosa che ormai non capita sempre. Complimenti"

jagdeep,5,A performance Beast CPU,N/A,This CPU has 24 threads and 16 cores (8E cores and 8P cores) which really makes difference when dealing with 3d graphics and to prevent bottleneck issuesDoesn't cause a CPU and GPU bottleneck as I only get about 45% GPU usage and stay under 10% load in most AAA titles like Destiny or Call of Duty.CinebenchR23 BenchmarksUsing CINEBENCH R23 I got a score of 27552 which is roughly 70 % of top performing CPU score of  43640.Using Geek Bench 6 testI got a Single core score of 2601 which is roughly 83 % of top performing CPU score of  3097 And a multi-core score of 12821 which is roughly 56 % of top performing CPU score of  21742

Amazonのとりこ,5,定格使用なら簡易水冷(240mm)でOK,N/A,2022年5月に購入。ASUSの簡易水冷(ROG240mm)で運用。ケースが古いので360mmは断念。定格使用でH.265のエンコード時にCPU温度は80℃後半を維持できます。Z690マザーなのでオーバークロック。6コアまでなら倍率54で回ります。温度は90℃に届くかどうか程度。電圧はoffsetで-0.05V。この場合Core temp読みで消費電力は241Wに届きませんでした。ただ、オールコアをいじり倍率50にしただけで300W近くまで消費するとともにCPU温度は一瞬で100℃へ。即サーマルスロットリングが作動します。いずれも室温は27℃での検証です。360mmの簡易水冷にしたとて一瞬で100℃に上がる温度は抑えきれないと思いますのでサーマルスロットリングに当てたくないのであればオーバークロックは難しいのでは？と思いました。単コアであれば54倍で安定動作しているので満足です。6700Kからの換装でしたが10分間の動画をH.265にエンコードしたとき、6700Kは約15分、12900Kは約7分で終了。時代の変化を感じます。premiere Proでの動画編集(4Kを8ストリーム)でも全コアフルパワーにはなりませんでした。エンコードするときと、ベンチを回すときくらいですかね。確かに発熱しますが普段使いであれば240mm簡易水冷でも運用可能です。
Chris H,5,Not necessary for everyone,N/A,"This isn't the processor for everyone, but it is very fast. The individual cores aren't significantly different from those in the 13th generation i7. But if you have a need for a lot of parallel processing then this may be the processor for you. I do software development, which it doesn't help 99% of the time, gaming, which it helps a little, and occasionally transcoding large amounts of video and music. During transcoding it helps a huge amount. I have over 300GB of FLAC audio files that I ripped from my CD collection, I never buy mp3s. I wanted to have that on my phone, but I didn't want to carry it at full rate because I can't tell the difference in the car, so I transcoded it. I had done that once before and it took more than a day on a five year old Ryzen 7. This machine took around 30 minutes. 30-40 times faster. At work the optics team, which uses ray tracing software to design optical telescopes and laser focusing lenses, uses i9s in preference to Xeons. The Xeons might be faster under some circumstances, but the machines are hugely expensive, so the i9s are much better for price performance. Would I buy it again? I'd probably buy the 13th generation, but if I had any sense I'd just get the 13th gen i7."

Mike,5,"Best CPU I've owned, Lowest temps and usage",N/A,"This thing never goes over 15 percent usage, and most games its actually using 0-4 percent. Even on Escape From Tarkov at max settings 4k 140+ fps its using 4 percent at max and usually is at 0-1 percent, I don't know if it's my computer reading an error but I use a few apps to check including the task manager tab. I use an NZXT AIO and the temps on this thing are under 20 idle and when I'm gaming on any game it never goes over 45 and usually is in the low 30s. I tried WOW classic, Retail,  Cyberpunk, Spiderman , and regularly play Escape from tarkov and all at 4k max settings and this thing just stays cool and and low usage. My GPU barely works as I have a 3090 TI, my GPU is usually at USAGE 40-50 percent at max 60 percent and stays cool, so I don't think anything is bottle necking.My old computer has an I5 and I have a laptop with an I7 and when I am gaming they are usually at 90+ percent usage. Even my friend with the AMD 5800x3D was getting at least 30+percent usage for AAA games. This is the first Computer I've built where I'm actually not even worried about the CPU for how cool it runs. I'm really shocked on how good its performance is, Definitely recommend."

mike,5,Thing is pretty nuts,N/A,"I've only had it about a month, but so far it is complete overkill for gaming... I haven't seen it go above 50% pushing it as hard as I can other than stress testing lol. I bought it so hopefully in 10 years it can still do some stuff hahaha."
bilal waheed,5,i9-12900K an excellent buy it！！,N/A,"Had a 11900K prior to this one, and as fast as it was even being overclocked to 5.3 ghz - the 12900K is just simply better. Put a minor overclock to 5.2 ghz and it's been so nice. P cores are freed up to do what they're supposed to do. E cores do the chores! Was hot at first before undervolting, but now that's done and temps are high 70s with a 360 mm Corsair AIO. Paired up with a Z690 from MSI and a RTX 3090 it's just the perfect combo. 12900K is completely free to do the data processing for the game, and 3090 handles the graphics side in all my triple A titles without needing to borrow from the system memory at all - needing to pull data through the processor. Resizable bar enabled and it's been awesome. Was worth every penny."
2sofakinggreat,5,Great Upgrade from 9900K,N/A,"So far this thing is great! I upgraded from the 9900K and this has been a noticeable difference. I'm still in the process of updating drivers and reinstalling some software. I haven't done any overclocking so the Cinebench score and temps are straight stock settings.After seeing all the info on how hot this thing can get I added the Thermalright contact frame. It was a breeze to install. I watched the Gamer's Nexus video about this frame and followed their directions.For the motherboard I went with a MSI Z690 MPG Edge Wifi DDR4 so I could reuse my current RAM. I had to order a LGA 1700 bracket for the NZXT Kraken X73 AIO. I ordered both the frame and the LGA 1700 mount from Amazon and both arrived fast and were exactly what I needed.So far my temps are staying in the general range of my 9900K. I'm planning to do a little gaming this week with it so I'll have a chance to see how it does under my daily use. I also do a bit of Premiere and After Effects so I'm looking forward to seeing how it works there as well.Overall, this is probably way more processor than I NEED. I was still able to do what I needed to do with the 9900K. I built the 9900K in 2020 during the height of the astronomically high PC price wave. I ended up getting this processor for about $100 less than I paid for the 9900K two years ago. So the price-to-performance upgrade for me was a no brainer.If you want a fast processor at a reasonably decent price, this is a great one to get. Just be aware you will need to pay attention to your cooling."

I'm not a gamer, so yes I understand it's not a huge bump in performance for those applications. Video Editing is another story."
Martazcoleman,5,Be careful,N/A,"Are usually go for the best products and it was a mistake for my first PC build I chose this chip and I didn’t know it runs that hot I built my PC I had enough fans but I had a 240 mm radiator I want a Micro Center and had to get a 360 mm cooler from the pool. The temps were at 89 to 92°C after the deep cool AIO under stress, test and bench testing the temp stay under 60°C , other than that I game hard on it and stream and the CPU usage never goes past 30%. It’s pretty overkill but that’s how I like my PC."
MSA,5,12th Gen Top Tier,N/A,"Purchased this for my new rig as opposed to an i7 based on price point at time of purchase (this was actually cheaper than the i7).Paired with RTX 4060TI 8GB.NO regrets.This can handle anything I throw at it, without issue (gaming wise) and never goes above 50/55C (not overclocked and cooled with 240MM AIO from Corsair) Idles around 32/33CVery responsive with plenty of clearance if I ever want to OC this guy.Heat was a concern after reading reviews and only having a 240MM radiator (sitting over a 4060Ti), but no issues - heat or performance) at all.Great time to buy with new gen just arriving recently."
Kira,5,Amazing CPU,N/A,"Purchased this CPU to finally upgrade my tired 8086k that I have had for close to 4 years now, and considering I also own a 3090 I was lucky enough to get last year, it was time. Paired with said gpu and a MSI Tomahawk Z690 with a Noctua NH-D15 Chromax Black cooler, this cpu runs complete marathons around my old 8086k. Certain games that would fully saturate my 8086k while also getting notifications from something like Discord would introduce very bad stutter, however those are completely eliminated with the 12900k. Temps are high when Im doing full resolution photo renders from my DJI Air 2S or Sony a6400 or straight up benchmarking, but that is expected and I'm not one to sweat about 80-90c temps, but if you are I would recommend the 12700k/5900x as they both run cooler and draw less wattage. However in gaming with multiple different Firefox tabs and discord/telegram open, it never even touches 70c, so your experience may vary depending on what type of work load you are doing. Make sure that if you do have a high powered gpu that you also have a high output power supply with a high efficiency rating as well, as my system can suck north of 600-750w full tilt (my power supply being a 1200w platinum EVGA that doesnt break a sweat under full load)."
Levi Biddle,5,Beautiful technology.,N/A,If someone ever asks you 'what is a GPU bottleneck' buy them a 12900k lmao.It's so good.
Derek Wilson,5,Great Performance!,N/A,"I love the Intel i9 unlocked processor. I have always used Intel and will continue to do so. All of my games operate smoothly, the graphics are amazing used with the correct moniter and Gpu. In my opinion Intel beats Ryzen hands down."

Joseph McMillen,5,Powerful CPU,N/A,"the CPU run fast and stays cool, the performance was great ,test run at 5.2Ghz the temperature not over heat.run with my  solidworks software that cpu was great."
Joseph Allen,5,Absolute Saint,N/A,This thing was so patient with me as I turned it on without a cooler several times because my pump was failing. Sure it shut off when it hit ~102 Celsius but there was no long term damage and now it serves me well with a working pump. We love to see it.
torreon49,5,Great CPU - POWER,N/A,"Bought this CPU on sale, and it runs fast and stays cool. Mine is running at 5.2 ghz with temps in the 40's on AIO on an ASRock Z790m ITX. I am super impressed at this combination of speed and reasonable temps. Have not gamed yet, but I expect killer performance!!"
soaknewe (so can you),5,It's a work horse,N/A,"Using this to serve movies and shows using PLEX, handles continuous recording of several 4K surveillance cameras using Blue Iris, runs a web server (just for family), and controls a Z-wave home automation program involving several nodes. I also use it listen to my collection of music. It does all of these tasks (along with other minor things) without a sweat. Generally it keeps under 15% utilization. Thank you Intel!"
Kiss Shot,5,Es excelente y versátil,N/A,Si quieres jugar un poco y hacer cosas profesionales este seria el indicado por la distribución de núcleos que tiene.
Metragoon,5,Insanely fast computation!,N/A,I only used laptops up to this point and this is my first PC build however I got this processor specifically for Workstation class computation and high performance gaming. The Core i9-12900K is blazing fast and uses very little watts for gaming mostly hovering around 65W~80W in the games I have played so far. It renders 3D projects at such a speed I hardly have time to do something else before it is complete which is a great change of pace. I would say the Core i5-12600K is better geared for gaming and this is much more geared towards production or enthusiast class gaming. I highly recommend this processor or anything in the 12th gen Alder Lake family.Full System Specs:・ASUS Prime Z690-A・Noctua NH-D15 Chromax Black・Intel Core i9-12900K 5.2GHz・NVIDIA RTX A5000 24GB ECC・G.Skill Trident Z5 RGB 32GB 5600MHz・Samsung 980 PRO 2TB M.2 NVMe・Samsung 970 EVO Plus 2TB M.2 NVMe・Samsung 970 EVO Plus 2TB M.2 NVMe・Samsung 970 EVO Plus 2TB M.2 NVMe・EVGA Super Nova G5 850W 80 Plus Gold・Fractal Torrent Gray E-ATX Mid Tower Case
BigG,5,Zoooooom,N/A,Bought on sale.My rig placed in the 97 percentile. The pc is overclocked.The processor is running cool and stable. No issues yet.Would recommend
Nicho,5,Producto sellado como nuevo,N/A,Bien empacado y nuevo.
Mike,5,"Got with the 900d Optane SSD, killer deal, but better CPU",N/A,"It's great, I'm using 13900k but wanted a better cpu for my 2nd PC, and it's great, especially for compute tasks and multi-threaded workloads. The raptor lake,  and forthcoming, will of course be better, but if you need the best Alder Lake CPU and can find a decent deal, it won't let you down. I'm able to cool it efficiently with a Noctua N-14 (single stack, single fan setup) and it works great."
Zachary Tompkins,5,Perfect,N/A,"This CPU is top quality, it is easy to install and works great for gaming, it stays cool and I have had no problems with it."

ashaheen,5,Power at good price,N/A,"I bought it with price lower than I7-13700, which was very good choice and happy with the decision"
BUTTAWORLD,5,Love it,N/A,I was going to go for the 13900k but I took this one for half of the price and have to tell u love it thank you
SouthernKraken,5,Upgraded from i7-8700,N/A,It's been less then 24hrs since I upgraded from an i7-8700 and could instantly tell a difference in performance. Haven't had the need to overclock since it handles streaming on twitch/kick with obs while playing games on the same PC very nicely at stock settings.
Nicolas Doyle,5,Exactly as described,N/A,Fast shipping and great product
Blake,5,Powerfu and Fast,N/A,"many cores, able to run multiple virtual machines with unnoticeable slowdown to other functions. Stays at 1-3% when playing games paired with a  3070. May upgrade to 13th gen later, but i really can't complain in terms of performance. Only have a dualfan/dual heatsink cpu cooler and it stays below 60 celsius at all times. Rests at about 30."
Amazon Customer,5,Great CPU,N/A,This CPU is power hungry under load but in games the CPU is fast. This also works fine for workstation workloads but this shines in gaming for sure. Also if you have the cooling this CPU can be clocked even higher for better performance. But for this you will need a decent CPU cooler.
babyhef62,5,cpu,N/A,great price easy to install
Hokshukra,5,12 gen,N/A,Good
Sqoopi,5,The connector pins under the chip,N/A,"Now has a thin film over it. Don’t know how it receives electricity and signal from the socket on the motherboard, probably similar to wireless charging, but at least it protects the pins so less likely to damage them while handling the CPU during the build. After all CPU is the most or second mot expensive component in a PC build.Other than that, the increase in core count and speed, couple with gen 4 SSD and RTX 3090 ti, everything else is just slow"
Nick P Cucchiara,5,It comes in a pretty box too.,N/A,"Received at least a week earlier than the scheduled assessment for delivery.Not installed yet but if you look at video reviews I'm sure you know this processor is going to preform when you need it as a creator.At the moment I'm still using a 2010 year,  i7  that endured the test of time in a properly built computer.Now it's time for the i9 12900K LGA1700 creator build computer to handle photography & video production in 2022."

Joseph R.,5,Powerful,N/A,"This unit is powerful for all of your needs. Just remember this thing runs really hot!!! Make sure you use a good cooling system. Otherwise, you will have thermal throttling issues."
Jason E,5,Best processor I've ever owned.,N/A,This is the fastest processor I've ever owned and with it I upgraded my entire pc.  Even though I purchased last years model it's still extremely fast and works well.. Make sure you pair this with a good motherboard otherwise it can run pretty hot.
Daniel W.,5,Good but very warm,N/A,Could is great but. Boy does she put off some heat. Feels like a furnace under my desk
Matthew Schneider,5,Amazing CPU but bought at the wrong time lol,N/A,"This cpu is killer and can literally handle any game you throw at it on max settings, and the same can be said for most workload programs. However I bought it back in early 2022, when it was still way overpriced for what it is now"
Julián Ortiz,5,Feliz,N/A,Llegó excelente y sin problemas. Recomendado 100%

Jordie 1080,5,i9 Smooths as butter!,N/A,Awesome Cpu blazzzing fast !!!!!!  for gaming and other  tasks . i see that the temps for this cpu work up into the 70's and even higher 80 + my recommendation is to undervote your cpu if your just gaming that will lower temps. With good thermal paste Kingpin cooling KPX and a water cooler im getting 55-58c in gaming hope it helps.
Brian Klein,5,It works,N/A,Not sure if I bought the best in terms of value and performance!
Andrea,5,Potente!!,N/A,"Potente, velocidad, gran desempeño... De verdad una gran maravilla lo que hace este procesador."
Jeff,5,Amazing!,N/A,The processor is amazing. Upgraded from an Intel 8700k.  Paired it with 6400 mhz DDR5 memory on a AsRock z690 Taichi motherboard  and my Nvidia EVGA 3080Ti and I'm consistently in the top 5% of benchmarks world-wide with barely any tweeks except selecting the XMP profile in my bios. Blows away anything currently AMD is offering in the same price range.
Mohammedfaisal695@yahoo.com,5,Incredible cpu,N/A,"There's nothing more to say, if you only want gaming get an i7, unless you're into emulation that's the only instance where you'll get an actual edgeIt runs pretttty hot as it takes over 250 watts if it can, in my case over 270 so keep that in mind"
Alexander Gomez,5,Realmente veloz,N/A,"Llevaba 10 años trabajando con Xeon, y tengo que aclarar que han sido procesadores excelentes y duraderos, pero necesitaba actualizarme a un procesador que fuera más rápido y he tomado la desición correcta con este i9. Trabajo en diseño en general, edición de vídeo, animación y 3D, donde existe un beneficio gracias a su potencia, todo se mueve como mantequilla."
kevin c stewart,5,Awesome,N/A,This was a huge upgrade to my system for good price. Im back into the modern pc world. Win 11 runs great
Troy,5,As of 9/6/2022 this is the GOD of processors. If you want the BEST available this is it!,N/A,This thing is truly impressive. It also comes in a very shiny golden container. It makes you happy the moment you open the package. As far as I have researched this is the absolute best and most powerful processor on the market as or 9/6/2022. I definitely recommend.
Cavustius,5,Insanely Fast Processor,N/A,"I love this processor, it can handle anything I throw at it. The only thing I was concerned with, is that I bought it 'new', but the stickers were peeled off the Intel 12900k box, so I am not sure what was up with that, it looked like it still had the safety seal on it though, but at least it works."
Douski,5,Excellent CPU,N/A,"It will handle all your multitasking needs with ease, even while gaming.Only con I can think of is that it does run very hot so you'll need a high end cooler to get the best performance"
