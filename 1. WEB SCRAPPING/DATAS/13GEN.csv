Yeng,1,DO NOT GET,N/A,"i'd say don‚Äôt get this unless you want your CPU to die within a year, i didn‚Äôt even overclock too!, and it seems that within this year i got blue screens of death and my pc started crashing out of nowhere, tried all possible online fix's but they did not work, so i brought it to the shop and they took a couple weeks to figure out the problem,  they told me everything works fine, and when they tested the CPU with a different one it worked and told me this is the first time in 3 years for him to find out that a CPU would turn out horrible from overclocking or just in general and i personally never overclocked my CPU, so trust this and go for a different one and make sure its actually legit. unless i can get another one for their mistake i wont be changing my mind"
Amazon User,1,Crashes frequently,N/A,CPU crashed frequently on my Asus Strix ROG Z790. Still waiting for Amazon to finalize a refund for a defective item. Maybe these are better bought at a brick and mortar store.
Old Audio Nut,1,It came USED.,N/A,"The box was opened, the i5 sticker was missing. The CPU had some of the heat sink gray goo on it.The description did NOT say USED or OPEN BOX.Then to add INSULT to INJURY I have to drop it off at a UPS Store 12 miles away!The price when up so now I get to eat that difference too for a mistake I didn't do."

Claudia M M,1,Aqu√≠ est√° el I5-13600k,N/A,its just fine
Andrea,3,"Processore performante, stock cooler pessimo.",N/A,"The processor itself© is© great. Responsive and performing in standard applications (internet, office) but a heatsink must be taken into account because© the stock one is noisy and inefficient."
Dylin,3,The King of Mid-Range Gaming? (With a Few Quirks),N/A,"The Intel Core i5-13600K is the latest champion in the mid-range desktop processor arena, promising top-notch gaming performance and efficient multitasking. But does it reign supreme, or face dethronement by rivals? Let's sharpen our critical swords and delve into its strengths and weaknesses:Pros:Performance Powerhouse: 14 cores (6 P-cores + 8 E-cores) and 20 threads deliver exceptional performance for gaming, content creation, and demanding workloads. Compared to its predecessor, the 12600K, it offers a significant performance leap.Gaming Prowess: Tears through even the most graphically demanding games with ease, boasting high frame rates and smooth gameplay at 1080p and beyond.Multitasking Maestro: Handles heavy multitasking like a champ, effortlessly juggling multiple applications, browser tabs, and demanding tasks simultaneously.Overclocking Champion: Unlocked multiplier allows for enthusiast-level overclocking, squeezing even more performance out of the silicon for those seeking ultimate power.DDR5 and PCIe 5.0 Support: Future-proofed with support for the latest DDR5 memory and PCIe 5.0 technology, ensuring compatibility with cutting-edge hardware upgrades.Cons:Power Hungry Prince: This performance comes at a cost, with a higher TDP (125W) and potential for increased power consumption compared to lower-power alternatives.Temperature Tantrums: Can run hot under heavy load, requiring beefy cooling solutions to maintain optimal performance and prevent thermal throttling.Pricey Pedigree: Carries a premium price tag compared to some Ryzen 5 competitors offering similar performance in certain scenarios.Windows 11 Preference: While technically compatible with Windows 10, Intel recommends Windows 11 for optimal performance and feature utilization.Motherboard Matchmaking: Requires a newer LGA 1700 motherboard, adding to the overall upgrade cost.Verdict:The Intel Core i5-13600K is a force to be reckoned with in the mid-range gaming processor category. Its exceptional performance, overclocking potential, and future-proof compatibility make it a tempting choice for serious gamers and creators. However, the higher power consumption, price tag, and potential thermal issues require careful consideration.Overall Rating: 4.5 out of 5 stars (with a slight temperature-related deduction)Should You Buy It?Absolutely! If you're a hardcore gamer or demanding content creator seeking the best value for performance in the mid-range, and aren't afraid of a little thermal taming, the 13600K is a top contender.Consider alternatives: If budget, power consumption, or Windows 10 compatibility are major concerns, explore Ryzen 5 options or consider the slightly less powerful (and cooler) i5-13500."
Sai,3,Not compatible with ASRock Steel Legend ATX,N/A,"Bios flash to update the motherboard for it to be able to use this 13th gen CPU, but the flash didn't work so the CPU could never be read by my ASRock Steel Legend motherboard. I have to buy a 12th gen CPU instead because of this problem assuming its the CPU that wasn't compatible with it."
Stefano Bruni,4,Intel Core i3-13100 processor 12 MB Smart Cache Box,N/A,"CPU Intel Core i3 di tredicesima generazione molto prestante, si pu√≤ usare sia per il gaming che per il lavoro a livello professionale.

Justin,5,Great cpu for gaming,N/A,"Upgraded from an i7 8700k and can say I am very happy with my upgrade. I got a noticeable jump in average fps, but the real improvement that can be felt while gaming was the increase in 1% low frame rates.This processor is a strong performer for the price - especially if you consider using DDR4 RAM if you‚Äôre on a tight budget."
C. Kerekgyarto,5,13th Gen rules,N/A,Went from i7 7700 to i5 12400f to i5 13600k. This processor is going to be in my machine for the next couple years. Probably gonna skip 14th Gen unless it‚Äôs mind blowingly better.I am paired with a 3070 Ti currently. I would have no worries pairing this with any 40 series card. I might wait for next gen GPUs as well.

richard morin,5,compatibility Z-790 gigabites,N/A,plug and plug. superb performance gaming
James,5,Unreal performance for the price,N/A,"Loving the price to performance with the 13600k, considering I made the upgrade from a 6700k. The technology is leaps and bounds for roughly same value.There is also no reason to choose an AMD5 CPU this year over the 13th gen Intel chips. Maybe a X3D but definitely not the 7000 series of CPUs."
Gabe,5,Awesome CPU!,N/A,This processor is blazing fast! The only con I can think of is the temps with factory motherboard settings. I'm sure the issue is the power settings from the motherboard
Jesse Jxmes,5,Low temps; but also runs everything flawlessly,N/A,I had a 10700k before this. Day and night. Paired with a 4080 and it does 1440p 240hz on most titles without hiccups.
Daniel Baldwin,5,Absurd value,N/A,"Best value you can get right now, and it's really no compromise of performance compared to an i7 considering the price"
Muy lindo,5,Bueno,N/A,Excelente product

Tommy,5,Good performance at a good price,N/A,"Fit well, works well, enough said. Enjoying gaming on my new setup."
J,5,Great chip,N/A,I'm glad I waited for Raptor Lake because this chip is frequently outperforming the i7-12700k or is at least close enough to call it even. Upgrading from an i7-4770 to this chip has been insane. Highly recommend for gaming.
Christopher P. Holmes,5,Fast reliable CPU,N/A,"Pairs VERY well with the 3080. No stuttering, fast speeds!"
John Nguyen,5,Upgraded from i5 3570k,N/A,Web pages load much faster.

Alex trejo,5,Una bestia,N/A,"It is a beast of a processor, to mount from a 3060 to a 4090, one of the best"
Just a dude,5,From 9600k to this.,N/A,"Words cannot describe the change in performance.I thought my 9600k was still a decent chip before I upgraded. Now I see although it was decent, I was missing a lot. My rtx 2080 super didn‚Äôt get upgraded this year but I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll need to by next year as it‚Äôs now always peaked at 100% in games. While my gpu works a sweat trying to not burn itself to the ground, this 13600k sits around 20-30% usage and around 50 degrees Celsius in most situations.Depending on the motherboard, you may want to tweak ‚ÄúCPU lite load‚Äù settings. My MSI mobo defaulted to mode 12 and was causing overheating issues due to current. Now dialed back to mode 9, I have lost no performance what so ever, I actually gained almost a thousand extra points in cinebench by not letting it get hot.Overall I‚Äôm very happy and would highly recommend this cpu to anyone."

Thom Harris,5,Best value for my needs,N/A,"I got the i5-13600K to meet my immediate needs for my new HTPC build which is also used for video creation. Because I'm not in a real rush to create and edit my short videos, this processor is all I need now and in the immediate future. Realizing that the LGA1700 processors may end production soon, I can still upgrade to the i7 and i9 to keep pace with ubiquitous software bloat."
Michelle Stone,5,I like a processor that also has graphics,N/A,"I bought this to build a gaming pc with. But I like CPUs that have a graphics option. This gives me a little wiggle room when I'm debugging a system. When I'm putting it together, I can get the mother board assembly out without plugging in a GPU.I'm using this in a pc that primarily plays World of Warcraft. A core I5 is plenty for that. I'm sure an I3 is more than adequate. I'm using a Deep Cool cooler in a well ventilated case and it doesn't get above 72 degrees celsius, 51 degrees over ambient. I'm not a CPU snob and have used AMD and Intel equally over the years. I wanted thunderbolt ports and that pretty much limited me to Intel this go around. I am not disappointed. My machine gives me all the performance I need. FWIW, I'm running a 7800XT GPU in the system if that is of any interest."
Steverollin,5,Great CPU for air cooling,N/A,I run this with the cooler NH-U12A and max temp 60C running games like Cyberpunk and Helldivers 2.
Ken,5,Amazing CPU for gaming,N/A,"There's really not much that needs to be said. If you're upgrading to 13th gen Intel, and don't require the additional non-gaming related benefits of 13700k or 13900k, you can't go wrong with the i5-13600k. Even with XMP enabled to 6000Mhz & a Noctua NH-U12A tower cooler on top, this beast never gets truly hot in any game. Granted, I have a very good case for airflow, but regardless it's extremely rare I ever see this CPU hitting the 70's when gaming (this includes 1440p gaming at basically maxed settings), with plenty of utilization headroom on top of that. I paired this beastly CPU with the Sapphire Nitro Plus Radeon 6950XT & have been having an amazing experience all around. If you're deeply considering 13th gen, & your main focus is gaming, then the 13600k will perform up there with the best without all the additional heat the higher end SKU's give off. Genuinely give this CPU a 10/10, never in my life did I ever anticipate an i5 to be this great, but just goes to show it's more about the generation and less about the number after the i. If you're considering the CPU but unsure as to its performance, I promise you wont be disappointed with it one bit. Including with its temperatures. No under-volting needed."
Raven Manuel,5,Love at first game ( After RIG upgrade),N/A,"I waited for a black Friday deal to get this chip, and boy oh boy... I'm blown away! I upgraded from an I5-8600K and the difference was clear, it was not clear eye, it was a monster of a CPU that can tear through any game you throw at it... As long as you pair it with a motherboard that doesn't hold back the power that is this processor."
Sam,5,Great workhorse,N/A,"I have this in my newest rig and it is performing pretty well, very happy with the purchase"
Marshall A.,5,Everything I expected.,N/A,I got really lucky and got a high-performing chip.Totally pleased with it and the AI overclocking on my ASUS ROG board.
Ian Jeffrey Raloff,5,"Great spped for main core, and plenty of other cores for VMs",N/A,I like that the new PC I built does not slow down when spinning up a Linux VM in Hyper-V. The processor has plenty of threads and supports all the latest features and chipsets.
Kyle Schow,5,Golden age of Gaming CPU's is back,N/A,"Update 12-3-23: With the release of the 14ty generation CPUs. Intel barely clawed an extra 1-2% performance wise in the 14600k. Save your money and roll with the 13600k that continues to drop in price. This processor demolishes any workstation/gaming task I throw at it.Intel nailed the 13th gen i5 loading it up with 14 cores. This thing is a little devil in benchmarks, and for $300(at least) less than the 13900k, you can have a processor that stays in punching distance when gaming. Absolutely killer value of you want to build a gaming rig with a quality processor that doesn't eat $600. I recommend getting the K version just in case for some reason one time you boot and your GPU doesn't read, your computer still has a gui. If you decide to go with an Intel processor, this is the best price to performance option."
PharaohSteve,5,"""Thine Technological Triumph: A Sonnet for the Intel Core i5-13600K""",N/A,"Oh, Intel Core i5-13600K, thou art a marvel of technology,A desktop processor that doth claim superiority.With clock speeds swift and cores so many,Thou art a powerhouse for any task plenty.Thine architecture, like a finely woven tapestry,Doth deliver performance with utmost efficacy.The tasks that once did vex and stall,With thee at helm, they crumble and fall.Thy clock speeds dance with lightning's might,Bringing forth swiftness to computations in sight.From gaming realms to design and creation,Thou art a boon to any technological vocation.Thy cores, like warriors in a grand parade,March in harmony, their power never to fade.Multitasking prowess, they do exhibit,As thou handleth multiple tasks, never to quit.Though thou art not the most noble in Intel's line,Thy value and power, they doth brightly shine.For those who seek a balance of might and cost,Thou art a choice that shall not be lost.So, let us raise our voices in great acclaim,To Intel Core i5-13600K, a processor of fame.In the realm of computing, thou reigneth high,A true companion for those who reach the sky."

Ron P.,5,"Very fast, Lots of Cores, Great transcoding",N/A,"I bought this CPU for a media/storage server I was building and I have not been disappointed. I am running Unraid OS with a number of Docker containers including Plex as well as virtual machines. Having 20 vCpus is awesome for some low requirement virtual machines and it's transcoding ability is great for Plex.A big reason I built a media server in the first place was to store my raw camera footage from storm chasing which is 4k 10bit which creates playback problems on a lot of hardware, it's just too large. I stood up a Plex docker container and added my footage and this CPU handles transcoding and streaming my videos no problem and it's great to go back and easily re-live some of those storms.We also have a growing library of TV shows and Movies and it also handles streaming those as well.I imagine this CPU would be awesome for gaming as well, but I don't have any experience with this chip and gaming but there are plenty of reviews that do go over that.Overall I'm happy with my purchase and would easily recommend this chip to anyone building a media server."
Deadeye,5,Amazing processor!,N/A,"Going from an old 4790K to this thing is like going from a biplane to the Concorde jet! This processor will crush any game out there. My main game is Flight simulator and the price to performance boost is outstanding. My old 1080SC is now the bottleneck in my system but both of them together makes even flying a helicopter in downtown New York, on multi-player, on ""high-end"" settings smooth as butter and the processor just sits at 55-60c! Amazing! The final piece of my new build was 32gb of corsair vengeance and I couldn't be happier unless I won the lotto.If you just need a solid gaming chip and don't want to break the bank, run, don't walk, to get this in your system today.BTW, I built my system using an ASUS ROG STRIX mITX, in an nr200p case and the Mugen 5 rev C does a great job keeping it cool using MX-6 thermal paste. The best part? It all fits neatly on my desk in my room. If you were waiting to build a new computer, now is the time. A 13th gen processor, DDR5 ram, a decent video card and a few SSDs and you'll be all set for the rest of the decade."
Martin,5,Excellent budget CPU,N/A,Best price-to-performance ratio in a CPU you would find today
Blue Sky,5,Great for a new computer build.,N/A,This is a very good CPU especially for the price. I love fast computers and don't see any reason to spend a lot more for very marginal gains.
honey the monster,5,This chip is a SCREAMER. Sleeper i5. Performs in the i9 tier. Get it.,N/A,"I LOVE THIS CPU. It's marketed as a value chip for the performance conscious gamer - at least in the reviews I've seen but that misses the mark. At 70 fewer watts than the i9-13900K you can actually cool the thing on air and enjoy similar single core performance, and with a respectable multicore performance score as well.My chip actually runs faster than Passmark says it should, but that might be because of my RAM. I got the K chip to get faster DDR5 speeds, not faster clock speeds, since I'm on air cooled, but at 5.1GHz I'm not for want of more cycles.My last CPU was an AMD Ryzen 7 4750G. Respectable for its day, but when I saw the performance of this Intel I decided it was time for me to switch back.My recommendation is that if you're running an air cooled gaming system, strongly consider this chip even if you have the cash for a 13th gen i9. You'll actually be able to keep it cool with a good cooler. I use a Noctua NH-DL12 with it and it's great."

Dan,5,Gaming value champ,N/A,"If you are building a PC for gaming, look no further than this CPU. Just built a SFF PC with this bad boy and an rtx 4070 for 1440p focused gaming and it absolutely dominates. Getting 240 frames in Overwatch 2 and consistently 200 FPS in single player games in high quality."
James Burroughs,5,Still picking my jaw up off the floor!!! Cowabunga!!!,N/A,"I am extremally happy with this CPU. Blazing fast and very stable, runs supper cool. I am only running a dual fan cooler and it idles at 24c and when iRacing stays in hi 40's to low 50's. Only game/ Simulator I use is iRacing. I use some hi-tech 3d modeling programs. Both really stress the CPU. I love this unit, cheap but loads of features."
Hugo Stiglitz,5,Monster CPU for the price,N/A,"I'm sure it'll be obsolete by the time someone reads this but right now this is the best CPU for the money.Just look at the benchmark scores. It beats even the best cpus from 2 or 3 years ago and beats i7s from Intels 12th gen easilyIts great for video and audio editing. If it's for gaming, you'll be good with this for 10 years if the last 10 is anything to go by. And you can overclock it too to get even more out of it"
E_The_Real_Dragon,5,FAST FAST FAST,N/A,"Absolute best bang for the buck...  I wanted to go i9 or at least i7 but with this latest round of intel processors, the extra $100-$150 per upgrade just did not seem worth it. I am very happy with my i5. Paired with an RTX 3060 TI, I am running super smooth with ultra graphics on most games that I am playing.. Currently playing Hogwarts in 4k borderless ultra graphics and ray tracing and maintaining 60 fps on a 4k television... Love it. It is so much faster and smoother than my other PC running the latest AMD processor."
Jason,5,Hot and Fast,N/A,"This CPU runs real fast when paired with good RAM. I'm hitting 25,500 in cinebench r23 multi core workload. I manually overclocked it to 5.3ghz p-core, 4.6ghz e-core. It definitely produces a lot of heat, so make sure to get a big AIO or high end air cooler. You do not want to cheap out on a cooling solution or else you'll be leaving performance on the table.Only gripe with this cpu is the fact that intel markets this as a 14 core cpu, even when the e-cores aren't exactly a big deal in game. Those p-cores do real good work, but the e-cores are lacking. I don't like the $300+ price tag on this, but it does beat Ryzen 7000 series, so I'm satisfied with my purchase."
Patrick Tierney,5,This CPU is very fast.,N/A,The 13th gen cpu's from intel are very impressive. This i5 is no slouch either and can throw its wieght around with the i7 and i9s of previous generations. In Cinebench i got a score of 23605 points. I have an aio 360 ml cooler on it and my temps rarely get above 50c when Im gaming or editing. At idle it stays around 30c. Under load the temps did not go above 80c. This CPU will pair fine with any gaming setup and its ddr5 compatible with is a bonus.
Michelle,5,Beast of a cpu,N/A,"This cpu can handle 4k at max like making ice cream, and with a 4060 ti is just a cherry on top!Beast of a cpu."
Jorvial,5,Nice,N/A,"Up to standards. Worried at the beginning since the processor was not set in place inside the box, but still works normally."
J,5,Good cpu,N/A,"I built my mom a new pc with this cpu. It is really fast! Her last computer was 10 years old, this should last at least that long. The on board video this chip supplies works great for what she does which is email, YouTube, ms office."
Brandon,5,Good and Hot,N/A,Absolute upgrade compared to my previous CPU but this one spits out heat like the summer sun. I believe you might want to invest with a good CPU cooler and properly do your install but it'll work like a champ.
Shenanigans,5,Runs cool with air cooling,N/A,Overclocked with basic settings on a z790 mobo. 5.3ghz easy and maxes at 54 degrees c. under load. I upgraded mobo and cpu from a i7 7700k so I could get windows 11 and reduce my windows boot times from 2 minutes to about 8 seconds.
McKenzie WIlson,5,Great use,N/A,I have been using this quite much and it‚Äôs great my laptop has the i7 and I‚Äôm use to a quick system and this has exceeded my expectations I have enjoyed the experience and think that I would use again for my next build.

Ryan Williams,4,Good processor but beware of fan,N/A,I was having issues with a new build where I wasn't able to adjust any of my fan speeds. The included fan was not spinning faster than about 600 RPM and luckily the processor throttled itself at 100C to prevent death. After taking the fan off and powering it separately it spun up to 3000RPM. I noticed that the wires were pinched along the heatsink because the housing was screwed down too tight. It happens. After fixing it and screwing it back on (not as tight) everything seems to be working. If the CPU wasn't throttling it would have died because of a tiny mistake in the fan wiring go figure.
Kendon,4,Stay Cool,N/A,"Exactly what I'd expect from an Intel processor.The price point to performance ratio is good.This isn't overclockable and doesn't suffer from heavy heat ranges allowing the provided fan to act as an adequate option for CPU cooling.I wasn't expecting this to come with a cooler and didn't intend on using it when I found out it did come with one.However when I found out my AIO was just a little too big for my build this cooler came in clutch! It's nothing pretty but it does the job. It come with the standard pre-applied thermal paste that you would expect, making installation very easy. The fasteners are push-plug style, no screwing required.I ran this with just that cooler for 8+ hours in a stagnant air case under moderate loads and the temperature stayed at a safe level."
albert,4,Es buen producto,N/A,"I give it 4 stars because I think that for the price it should have had better presentation, only the processor arrived, it did not come box or heatsink.

I preferred to invest the money saved in the CPU. After intensive research on the internet and taking into account my planned budget, I decided on the Intel Core i5 13600K CPU.

This is easily overcome with an aftermarket cpu retainer, for less than ¬£10.00 thremalrite supply one that allows even well distributed pressure to hold cpu in place without this risk."

stephen craig nicholson,5,Review,N/A,This CPU is very good i upgraded from an i9 9900k and this CPU is actually much faster I would recommend an 5600 ram though to pair with this because of it been a newer CPU I did notice a 5600 ram ran fine on with this CPU also the ram has to be ddr5 not ddr4 just so there's no issues go for the i5 version if upgrading from a older gen CPU because the i5 is actually fast saves money on electricity and also it saves money having to go spend alot on the i7 or i9 then if you choose the i5 version a 850 psu will be just fine I definitely would recommend this version though

Tasha,5,Diamond in the ruff.,N/A,"Hello,So I bought this processor to replace my ryzen 7 2700x that finally decided to die on me. I have had the ryzen since launch.I was expecting similar performance maybe slightly better. However, this i5-13400f not only performs better than my old ryzen. It also does it at much cooler temps then the ryzen put out. My ryzen idled at 35c and got up to around 79c on heavy load. The i5 idles at 22c and has only gotten as high as 55c max under heavy land. That's 13 degrees cooler than the ryzen at idle and 24 degrees cooler under load.With that said that's a huge improvement over my old ryzen. Which I shouldn't be surprised that ryzen is a few generations old now. But damn. Definitely worth grabbing one.My old ryzen would get bogged down if I created a video game asset in blender around if I went too crazy. So far the i5 hasn't been bothered by anything I do in blender. Or in zbrush, maya, 3ds max, or substance painter."

Present temp, writing this review, is 25 celsius. Surfing and watching videos on youtube, temps are around 29-35 celsius. Have not tried the Intel supplied cooler.Granted my gpu is not recent, I have yet to update my gtx 950, encoding video using cpu in handbrake is way faster  than when encoding using the gtx 950 nvenc and the resulting file size are quite smaller for the same visual quality.Encoding  pushes the  cpu and water cooling fans to 100%  and temps climb up to 99 degrees but it all works flawless.Have yet to game with it, will do when I get a new gpu."

J Hartman,5,Good all around processor,N/A,"I originally got this cause I wanted to try out Intel's p cores/e cores.  Coming from a long time AMD user, this intrigued me.So far, it's got it's ups and downs.  But it seems to be at par with the Ryzen 7 5700g.  Though better in lots of ways....like, being to use either DDR 4 or 5.  Or PCIe 4 or 5, depending on mother board.  While the Ryzen 7 5700g is stuck at PCIe 3.Anyway, I loved it.  But decided to swap with with a i9 14900k.I donated it to a friend along with a few other parts to upgrade her system from an A10 to this.  So far it's been real good to her.The only odd note about this processor and it's IGPU counterpart is, this one have more cache.  While the IGPU version have less cache.  Try to weigh in your options when looking at this over the other.  I picked this due to a tiny drop in price with the added extra cache.  But, it wouldn't be great for my itx rebuild I did later on.  This low powered CPU (compared to a Ryzen 7 5700g) would benefit with the IGPU when going for a plain HTPC build."

I recommend using 22.04.3 (current) because it probably fixes that issue.With 20 cores total this processor is just a downgraded i5-13600k, I don't overclock anyways so it fits my needs.

Marv,5,Bought this processor and a cheap MATX motherboard so I could run MicroSquish Windoze 11,N/A,"So I was stuck on Windows 10 with my LGA 1151 core i7-6700.  This processor at an affordable price more than doubled, maybe tripled my cpu performance while still accepting my older DDR4 3200 ram and m.2 storage.  Also allows me to update my machine to Windows 11 as a 13th gen cpu.  I considered running 8th gen chip in my older mother board by flashing the bios with a coffee lake chip support, but rather than deal with all the isolation on the cpu pins and bios frustration, i opted to spend 60 bucks for a new MATX board and this cpu.  The only complaint I have is the cpu box was clearly opened and I am left wondering if this was dropped into someone else's board at some point and returned.  I don't like that when the product is being advertised as new.  The seller was Amazon LLC too so I am not sure what is going on with that.  I have half a mind to return it for a replacement but alas it is installed and seems to be running fine so I really don't want to pack it up and ship it back.  My chip runs pretty cool with the stock fan, 3d mark cpu stress tests never took it above 71C but that fan sure kicked in when the cpu was running at 100% utilization.  At idle on my computer the chip purrs along at 30-35C with the fan running somewhere around 40%.  All in all a good purchase to get my machine ready for Win 11.  Will work for a budget gaming build but expect to pay a little more for a good GPU."

There was no marking on the top of the CPU  - there were scratches, looked like someone had scrubbed off thermal paste.2. There was thermal paste residue in the plastic packaging, and noticed a small amount of thermal paste on the CPU connections.I did not attempt to install - returned it right away, and ordered a replacement. It looked like a genuine product, but was probably a return, not new.Be sure to thoroughly check this product before installing."

mklinkel,1,out-of-the-box nicht zu gebrauchen,N/A,"On the one hand, Intel delivers a very fast CPU here, but it is practically useless out-of-the-box. The problem is the much too high power consumption and the associated thermal problems.Even with a 360 AIO water cooler (bequiet Silent Loop 2), the CPU goes to over 100∞C under load and is then automatically throttled. So in order to achieve a reasonably reasonable volume level, you have to undervolt (turn down the voltage) in the bios and limit the maximum power consumption. There are recommendations of 125W on the mains, which limits the performance of the CPU by about 10-15%. The joke is, if you set the power consumption to about 170-180W you can achieve even more power (e.g. Cinebench), because the CPU is then no longer throttled due to thermal problems. So if you feel like playing around in the BIOS and with Intel XTU in order to have a reasonably acceptable level after hours, you can go for the experiment. If you just want to assemble and get started and buy a 13600 or AMD. Sorry, but that's not "
My Public Unique Name,3,Overrated Chip. Over Priced,N/A,"You have to tune this chip for efficiency. Do not attempt to run this using stock motherboard settings. It will thermal throttle. I set mine to 88 watts, with a slight overclock. I keep all cores enabled. I have about 15-30 other settings to tune for efficiency.Now it runs cold\low fan speeds. You lose 5-8% of performance, but its not worth it. These chips should have been binned for slower speeds and power usage.Also over priced."
Sparky,3,Fast processor,N/A,But it runs very hot and needs a massive cooling system.  Even with the system I have I cannot overclock because it would exceed temp limits.

G. Weber,3,Hohe K√ºhlleistung zu empfehlen,N/A,"The 16-core processor offers high performance. The power consumption in practical operation is still surprisingly low for me.

Be careful with these processors not even with a good AIO of 360 and 9 fans lower the temperatures, when the hz rises the tempetarura can reach 100∫ easily, it is a shame that to give the maximum performance they sell you processors that look like they come overclocked from the factory, I recommend you lower the voltage a little at least 0.250 to lower the temps a little,  If you plan to use them for rendering, be very careful with the temps

Pedro Clemente,4,Recommended for content creation.,N/A,Really love this processor it‚Äôs really fast using the adobe apps. Recommended for content creation.
A Reader,4,"Great CPU, but hard to cool",N/A,"After too many years of gaming on an old i7-6700K I finally decided to pull the upgrade trigger this year.  I purchased the most up to date CPU and other components with the hope this one will last me as long as the last one did. Overall I think this is a great CPU, however it is a bit frustrating when you try to cool these things. Intel just keeps pushing these CPUs harder and harder to try and beat the performance metrics of AMD, but in the process they are making CPUs that are anywhere from near impossible to difficult at best to keep cool. After a lot of tweaking in the BIOS I finally got this one to stay below the 90 degree Celsius threshold, but that doesn't account for how hot it still makes my room when I'm gaming. The extra heat was kind of nice during the winter months, but as summer is approaching I'm wondering how this is going to pan out...Anyway, the CPU is completely as advertised and worked flawlessly out of the box. I didn't run into any errors or issues with this CPU. Overall I 100% recommend it because Intel has never let me down. I've been building my own systems for more than 20 years now too, so that's a pretty long track record of CPUs that just worked and never died. Because of that I can easily recommend this CPU and I would definitely order it again."
Skylar,4,Worthy Upgrade For 2023,N/A,"I had a Ryzen 7 3800xt cpu for a while now so I went for a new upgrade and went for Intel for this generation. This processor works faster and better compared to what I had previously. This cpu is basicaly like an efficient i9 12900k, so if your looking for a high end processor just get this 13th gen. Also at this time the 14th gen i7 just got released but based on the reviews its more like a 13th gen Intel ks proccesor. That why I never went that route."
LUIS FELIPE MEJIA SOLANO,4,Segundo Pedido de Intel Core i7-13700K,N/A,The second purchase of the product fulfilled its characteristics
corey,4,Main title needs more info,N/A,sure the chip works beautifully but I had no idea the k series didn‚Äôt come with a cooler which is very upsetting for the price point. I now realize very small at the bottom of description it says no thermal cooling. Wish it said that in the main details
Steve D.,4,FAST,N/A,"fast cpu, did not come with a cpu cooler. Make sure you get agood cpu cooler if you play games!!! This cpu runs very HOTif you max it out. Recommend water cooler or LARGE air cooled."
Craigc,4,Screaming fast processor that runs really hot.,N/A,"I got this for a new system build even though a little higher than I like to spend. But it has performed great.After, I noticed a drop in performance and doing research, I found out that these run very very hot and the thermal protection had kicked in to throttle the processor down. I tried a few Air cooled options that did the trick, but they were too loud for me, so I ended up with a Liquid cooled option which is what I would recommend to anyone using this processor. Currently, my idle temps are around 41c and at 100% utilization, temps average around 60-70 with a quick peak of 95. I dont personally like to overclock for my own reasons, but I did do some overclocking on this for testing and everything worked great with what I did. 13th Gen blows away 12th gen. This I7 even bests the i9 12th gen. Great chip as long as you keep it cool."
Al-Mothafar Al-Hasan,4,Best CPU for gaming with this value,N/A,"If you are looking to get the best gaming experience with the decent price and not getting poor processing power, this is your option, you get the flagship power with lower price than competitor.It is usually huge amount of power however in load, but for person like me keeping OC most of the time, this is where E cores getting into the play.I'm not Intel fan anymore, I wanted to get AMD but because AMD requires DDR5 and much expensive for no payback compared to Intel, I did choose this, and I'm not regretting it.So TL;DR: if you are short in budget, and want something last long for next years, get this one fore sure."

Andr√©s,4,Excesiva temperatura,N/A,"
Although it is a great processor and despite having liquid cooling, it does not drop below 38 degrees at rest (core load below 1-2%). In games with Battlefield 2042 with medium and 2100x1400 confinement, all cores at 90 degrees. Before you had an i7 8700K and its temperatures were much lower.

Species,4,Multi t√¢ches,N/A,You©don't need a my cooler like a big noctua or a watercooling to have its full potential but pay attention to the value of your motherboard (PL1: 125w; PL2: 253; iccmax: 407 A )
Tiziana Cence,4,Intel i7 13700kf,N/A,"Intel i7 13700kf lga1700 processor. On the processor there is not much to say, it is perfect for gaming and for graphics, better there is only the 13th generation Intel/Ryzen 9 series. The processor is kf, that is, without integrated graphics card, so if you attach the hdmi to the motherboard it will not give signals and will be attached to the video card, I recommend no less than a 4070 or a 7800xt. I expected a much higher packaging than the poor cardboard support, but in the end it avoids shocks so it's fine. Inside the package we find the instructions and the iconic sticker Intel.Il processor heats up quite a bit but a liquid cooler of at least 240 is fine. A well-made air cooler will also do. The price is high but justified if we consider that according to benchmarks it is better than a last generation i9. Highly recommended."

Just bought it! and working great except the temperatures!!!",N/A,This is my best buy so far for gaming and editing. It runs great whatever you throw. Excellent performance so far. Cinebench score is 29000 at 125 TDP.Suggestion: Buy only if you have very good amount of cooler.
Robert Johnson,5,Super Fast and temperatures aren't as bad as I expected,N/A,"I bought this to replace my 10850k after I realized how much it was holding back my 4090.  I bought an ASRock z790 PG lightning /d4 board to go with it so I could use my existing DDR4 ram.  The difference was night and day!  I have an ID-Cooling 280mm AIO (cheapest I could find on Amazon) with a contact frame and kyronaut thermal grizzly extreme paste and does not thermal throttle on Cinebench R23 unless I run 3 or 4 passes back to back.  I am thrilled with how well this CPU runs.I was able to bump my DDR4 up to 4200mhz in gear 1 (timings cl20/26/26/26/48) after a bios update from ASRock and this thing is rock solid and crazy fast!  I get an average of 30500 in cinebench r23 and it will overclock as far as you want - I have taken it to 5.7 and it runs fine, it just thermal throttles quickly at that speed.  I'm pretty sure I could overclock this beast to the moon if I threw a lot more money into a custom cooling loop, but it is plenty fast as is.  I have no regrets about not bumping up to the 13900k, I do gaming and code compiling and it is a dream for both of those workloads."
Karl K.,5,Fastest Intel CPU without serious issues.,N/A,"Upgraded to the 13700k from the 11900k and the jump in performance was nothing short of massive. This 13th gen i7 K is officially Intel's fourth fastest CPU on paper but in real life it's the fastest of them all in terms of stability as the the three slated above it (13900k,14700k and 14900k) are all plagued with issues that Intel won't discuss but admits to, albeit grudgingly. Until a fix-all patch is released, the 13700k is the best choice for gamers and content creators who won't be bothered with unpredictable bugs and BSOD fests. What good is it having a Ferrari but with an engine that's goes offline 20 times a day?  May as well go with a Porsche that works. At that level of performance these high-end CPU's more or less all perform equal (or would if they all worked properly), but it's easy to understand the frustration of owners whose 30-day window for return to Amazon is closed."

Dylin,5,Cant beat this value,N/A,"Intel Core i7-13700K: Gaming Beast with Brawn and Bandwidth, But Not Without BiteOverall Rating: 4.5 out of 5 starsFor: Serious gamers, demanding content creators, overclocking enthusiasts, those upgrading from older systemsAgainst: Pricey compared to previous generations, runs hot, requires beefy coolingPerformance: 5 out of 5 starsThe i7-13700K packs a serious punch. Its hybrid architecture with 8 performance cores and 8 efficient cores tackles demanding tasks with ease. Whether you're pushing pixels in the latest AAA titles or crunching numbers in complex spreadsheets, this CPU thrives under pressure. In gaming, expect silky-smooth frames at 1440p and beyond, even in the most demanding titles. Compared to its predecessor, the i7-12700K, it offers a noticeable performance boost, especially in multi-threaded workloads.Overclocking: 4.5 out of 5 starsThe i7-13700K is an overclocker's dream. It offers plenty of headroom for pushing clock speeds, unlocking even more performance potential. However, remember that this comes at the cost of increased power consumption and heat generation. Ensure you have a robust cooling solution like a high-end air cooler or AIO liquid cooler to keep things under control.Features: 4 out of 5 starsThe i7-13700K boasts impressive specs: PCIe 5.0 support for next-gen hardware, DDR5 memory compatibility, and Intel UHD Graphics 770 for basic graphics needs. This future-proofs your build and ensures you're ready for the latest tech as it emerges. However, keep in mind that the cost of DDR5 memory might still be a drawback for some.Value: 4 out of 5 starsWhile the i7-13700K delivers fantastic performance, it comes at a premium price tag. Compared to previous generations, the cost per core has increased. However, it still offers compelling value compared to its closest competitor, the AMD Ryzen 7 7700X, especially for gaming. Remember, you'll need to factor in the cost of a capable cooler and potentially DDR5 memory, further impacting the overall value proposition.Things to Consider:Heat and Power Consumption: This CPU runs hot, especially under overclocking. Invest in a robust cooling solution to avoid thermal throttling.Price: The i7-13700K is expensive compared to older generations and slightly pricier than its main competitor. Consider your budget carefully.DDR5 Compatibility: While future-proof, DDR5 memory is still more expensive than DDR4. Factor this into your overall build cost.Final Verdict:The Intel Core i7-13700K is a top-tier processor for serious gamers, demanding content creators, and overclocking enthusiasts. Its blistering performance, PCIe 5.0 and DDR5 support, and overclocking headroom make it a future-proof powerhouse. However, the high price, heat generation, and DDR5 compatibility requirements might be dealbreakers for some. If you're looking for the ultimate in gaming and multi-core performance and have the budget for a premium build, the i7-13700K is a worthy investment. Just be prepared to feed it some serious watts and keep it cool.Note:This review is based on my own research and comparison of benchmarks. Your results may vary depending on your specific hardware and software configuration"
Renato,5,Excelente procesador,N/A,"Excelente la entrega del procesador, por parte del vendedor, llega en una peque√±a caja, (hab√≠a leido del pulparindo - confirmado).Las funcionalidades que prove√© el procesador son las mejores con 24 threads, siempre recomendable conseguirse un buen enfriamiento liquido.

RubberCheese,5,Solid performance; runs cool except under load,N/A,"This processor performs well and is a solid performance upgrade from my old i7-6700K. According to HWMonitor, the CPU package hovers around 15W power consumption doing desktop tasks (web browsing / email / Office).Compared to my i7-6700K (video card and PSU unchanged; new motherboard, ram, and heatsink&fan):- System power consumption at idle and doing desktop tasks is about 5W higher than my 6700K in normal mode, or about 15W lower in ‚Äúeco‚Äù mode in my motherboard‚Äôs settings- Synthetic benchmarks (3dmark CPU Profile) indicate 2x performance for single-core processing and 4x performance for maximum threads- Real-life video encoding is roughly 3x faster using PowerDirectorNote that this LGA1700 socket is known to allow some bending (this causes poorer contact with heatsink which may cause throttling). This can be remedied by installing a pressure plate (I bought a Thermalright LGA1700-BCF for around $12).If you don‚Äôt need a built-in GPU, consider the i7-13700KF; the built-in GPU is nice to have but not always worth the premium. If you also don‚Äôt plan to overclock, consider the i7-13700F."

Samson Ghirmai,5,The quality you expect from Intel,N/A,"Purchased on sale for $334. The 13700k is the best value CPU if you require enough speed for high-end gaming + productivity (e.g. video editing/rendering, streaming, multitasking, etc). This thing is fast. I was able to undervolt it and overlock it to 5.5 Ghz (all p-core) and 4.4 Ghz (all e-cores). I could go higher if I wanted to spend more time on it, but this was a quick overclock. Perfectly stable and runs (relatively)cool with the undervolt. Intel is still my preference for CPUs and I don't foresee that changing, especially with all of the issues I've read regarding AMD chips (boot up issues, crashes, poor multi-core performance)."

It's a great CPU and is handling everything I throw at it.  Stays cool even without a fancy AIO / liquid cooling setup.  During the process of installing the CPU on the socket, it fell into place perfectly, but when adjusting the motherboard arm to secure the CPU into the socket, it did feel I had to put a bit more force than I would have thought necessary, but it clicked into place and is running smoothly with no issues.

adam,5,Outstanding performance and utilities!,N/A,"The highest package temps my CPU gets while running multiple applications is 85 degrees Celsius. And that's only for brief moments. Average 68 - 75 degrees while gaming with high graphics games with youtube running in the background. Maxes at the 253 rated watts for me, which really is fine. Average of about 100 watts and computer overall idles @ 65 watts, which is 25 watts less than my old i7 4th gen. No need to undervolt this CPU, even though you can, you'll just be giving yourself future headaches if you do. During the Cinebench stress test you get temps that max out at 98 - 100 degrees Celsius, but remember that's absolute max mode, 99% of users will never use this CPU for more than several minutes at. If Intel's Extreme Tuning Utility does not automatically download when installing, definitely get it from intels website and learn to use it. It is easy to use, and you won't regret it. I just use it for monitoring performance, but you can use it for easy optimize and under/overvolt with too, but I'd recommend doing any of that through your motherboard BIOS if you decide to. Most new BIOS's are easier and safer for that kind of stuff anyway. Do your research on which to use and how. Long story short if you want max performance to play around with just get a i9 processor, that's what those are made for, for everyone else there's this one!"

Buyer,5,Stable System,N/A,"I use this i7-13700K every day for about a year. I have Crucial RAM 64GB Kit (2x32GB) DDR5 4800MT/s CL40 Desktop Memory CT2K32G48C40U5 modules (4 of them), a Corsair RM1000x (2021) Fully Modular ATX Power Supply in a Phanteks Enthoo Pro Full Tower Chassis without Window Cases PH-ES614PC_BK in service for about one year as I write this review. For the most part, assembly was very easy. I do video editing, audio editing, streaming, wordprocessing, browsing and email with my setup. I use all of my SATA ports and even have a plug-in eSATA card for more ports. So most of my drive bays are filled. The cpu, dram and everything I have connected to my power supply and motherboard has been rock solid stable, and the case holds in all together. It just works exactly the way I want and have no anomalies. The power supply, motherboard and all components run cool in the case with an i7-13700K CPU, 128 GB of Crucial DDR5-4800 that is clocked at 5200 automatically set by the motherboard itself. My video card is a the very modest ASUS GeForce GT 1030 2GB GDDR5 HDMI DVI Graphics Card (GT1030-2G-CSM) because I transitioned my ancient setup from MBR to GPT and needed to be able to boot the old system in the new motherboard before updating the Windows 10 Pro config to GPT UEFI and still be able to boot legacy devices. Everything just worked like a Swiss Chronograph. I strongly recommend this cpu, dram, the power supply, the case, the ASUS ProArt Z790-Creator WiFi 6E LGA 1700, the Asus video card, and am also recommending the Crucial MX500 SATA drives I use. Is it all of this the fastest? I have no idea. Does it boot and work reliably everytime so far? Absolutely!"

Everything runs smoothly, I haven't had a single crash running the XMP Profile in BIOS for my RAM so it runs at full speeds.  This CPU blows the Ryzen 7 5800X out of the water.  Check out the UserBenchmark: AMD Ryzen 7 5800X vs Intel Core i7-13700K comparison on UserBenchmark's website for details, which is what I did before purchase.  It lives up to the benchmarks for me."
Duy Nguyen,5,Wonderful processor!,N/A,Spend the money once and get a good processor you wont regret!
Wolfgang Werner,5,As described,N/A,"I was close to give them a bad review but then I found out USPS was the problem with my delivery.  If possible, find another shipping method to avoid delays.  Product exactly as described, much needed! Now I can finish building my pc. Thank you"
Seth Magoon,5,Who needs an i9! This thing is amazing!,N/A,"I built a new computer during the height of covid (Dummy, I know, right?) and decided on a i9-9900k. I'm a sysadmin by trade, so remoting in and fixing servers has never been an issue with that processor..but for gaming..Titles like Cyberpunk, Days Gone, to even WoW..there were areas that my 3080 was being bottlenecked by the 9900k.I coupled this CPU with a MSI EDGE z790 DDR4 (I have fantastic Samsung B-Die CL14 3600 DDR4 from the previous build). So far, in Cyberpunk I'm seeing 25-30 more FPS on 1440p Ultra settings w/ Raytraycing on High. WoW is getting 50+ more FPS, and I'm getting over 100 FPS in Valdrakken, where I was getting 45-50 FPS with the 9900k with the same settings as cyberpunk (1440p ultra (10 graphics settings).I'm using the Corsair iCUE H100i Elite LCD 240mm AIO, with Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut Extreme thermal paste to cool this bad boy, and even at prolonged sessions in Cyberpunk, my temps are not getting above 65c. And no, I have not done the Contact Plate mod.TL;DR - This CPU is blazing fast, and if your current processor is a few years old it may very well be worth the upgrade. I don't claim to be Steve from Gamers Nexus, or a pro CPU tester - but I can tell you that this thing is amazing, and will serve you well for years to come."
Todd Warren,5,Nice,N/A,without a doubt good CPU stays cool over clocked at 35 c runs good worth the money.
jose cristobal,5,excelente procesador,N/A,"Despacho r√°pido, el producto lleno todas las expectativas, Es un procesador muy r√°pido, en mi caso lo uso para el dise√±o grafico, en pocas palabras es espectacular...!"
Matthew Humphrey,5,Powerful / cost effective CPU,N/A,"Paired with my 3060ti founders edition, I have yet to run a game that seems like this combo couldn‚Äôt handle. Apart from gaming it can handle multiple instances of tasks and run them all seamlessly. This is the most powerful CPU I‚Äôve had but it still impresses me how fast everything is and I have not seen its limits yet."
Joel,5,Feel the power,N/A,"I had a 6 year old Acer TC-780 desk top with an i7-7700 cpu. Due to not able to upgrade to windows 11 and microsoft scheduled to stop supporting windows 10 October 2024.  I gave myself a year to shop for a new PC Knowing Black Friday/Cyber Monday have the best prices and deals.  I like the Gaming RGB astatic and after months of researching online I decided I was going to Build my next PC.  Black Friday came early this year Thanks to Prime Day, and  MSI Mag Z790 Tomahawk MB,  and V- color DDR5 Oc 7200mhz 32g RAM, and MSI RTX4070 GPU And the Intel i7-13700K  all powered from a Gamemax 1050W PSU,  I have a Brand new POWERFUL Gaming PC That will serve me well in the years to come."
Paul Luu,5,Fantastic Performance/Value Workstation CPU,N/A,"The i7-13700K has i7-12900K performance at an i7 range price range. Please note I used an older Z690 EVGA Classified Board. I was required to flash because older boards cannot support the new CPU yet. I suggest people who used a 12th gen chipset and were looking to upgrade follow their respective motherboard‚Äôs vendor manual. The installation was incredibly easy, and I booted the BIOS after the BIOS update without any problem. I had hit 5 GHz on the CPU without overclocking. It also supported 6000 MHz DDR5 RAM without any issues after enabling XMP. The reasonable pricing for Z690 or Z790 boards makes the i7-13700K a good combo compared to AMD‚Äôs expensive Ryzen 7000 CPUs and motherboard costs. For people who are still on older generations, the vast E cores and P cores offered by Intel‚Äôs 13th gen make it worth it to accomplish CPU-intensive tasks like Handbrake or Adobe Premiere. This CPU runs cool with a 360 mm AIO and a high airflow case (around 30-36 C idle temperature for me). I also like to note the CPU fits only fits one way and the CPU lever has a bit of tension, so don‚Äôt be afraid when installing your CPU."
Amazon Customer,5,Fantastic CPU & Fast,N/A,"I love this chip, fast and efficient also stays cool with my 280MM AIO.  I had to replace my MB and Intel i7 8th gen 8700K so got this over the i9 and could not be happier.  Wish Intel would drop their prices but it is a value for what you get"
edouard Claude,5,Super,N/A,"Nothing to say, all is okay"
Isaac,5,Very Fast in 2023,N/A,"The i7 runs a bit hotter than the 13th gen i5, but I just couldn't resist spending a bit more for those extra cores. As of 2023, it's a razor-fast CPU for the average buyer - probably too powerful for anyone but power-users and video-editors. As for gaming, it'll run many older games at a high FPS even without any help from a GPU, and it handles modern titles without any problems, too.It CAN run with a low-power or stock-quality cooler for daily tasks, but I'd recommend investing in water cooling if you plan to throw heavy-duty loads at it, or good-performance air cooling if you're planning to buy it once and keep running it many years into the future."
Sasha4130,5,Very good CPU,N/A,I wanted speed without breaking the bank and this CPU fits the bill. Runs a little hot but not too much to handle with an AIO water cooler (I use a Deepcool LT520). Pleased with my build.
AS,5,Chews through everything without breaking a sweat,N/A,"Running in XMP mode, all cores synced, with ram clocked at 7200mhz! No problems whatsoever. Runs fast and cool compared to my old 5930k."
Kevenka,5,great CPU,N/A,Great value for my gaming PC :D
McQuade,5,Its top tier,N/A,its great. just buy it. or the 14700k.
Customer,5,Silicon lottery winner,N/A,Open box/used good condition item. Purchased for my Wife's latest build... Wound up having a better memory controller than my old 13900KS ... runs reeeeally cool.
Carrera,5,Great CPU,N/A,"Absolutely great CPU, fast, efficient, and perfect for gaming. It‚Äôs the ideal CPU for gamers, especially coming from a 9700k. I noticed drastic improvements in my gaming and I highly recommend for others. Great buy."
Jerry,5,Very impressive,N/A,"Very impressive CPU almost on par with the i-9 just slightly fewer e-cores which if your not an editor or creator of some sort you really won't miss them. Gaming wise this CPU has hit all my benchmarks, with a solid score on cinebench time after time. Runs a little hot while gaming among other things roughly around 65 to 72¬∞C at highest times, but with the right cooler you will be impressed! Does not come with stock cooler! Would recommend"
Vermonter,5,Very fast,N/A,"I replaced a 7th generation I7 CPU with this one.  The difference in performance is dramatic (although I the also replaced the MOBO, which contributed to the improvement).  I may have bought too much CPU power.  The ASUS diagnostics that I run show that the CPU rarely runs at more than 10% of capacity (although I also installed a new GPU so most of the graphics processing is offloaded).Installation in the ASUS motherboard was straightforward, although the socket size has changed from my previous Intel CPU, and I had to purchase a new mounting bracket for my cooler, which I did not replace."
Mikhail E Merkurieff,5,"Super Fast, can run hot",N/A,Super fast and stable CPU. Note that it can run hot because of the higher voltage it can use. I made sure to get a nice AIO for it. Coupled with an arctic freeze II 306 it rarely gets above 30C.
SKim,5,"Unbeatable, for the price",N/A,"It‚Äôs insane, the speed you get for its price is absolutely great. It‚Äôs granted me a 40+ fps increase on Baldur‚Äôs Gate and has helped me in development and lighting in 3D applications. It been stable at 5.4 ghz and is amazing for games. The die is larger than the older CPUs due to its newer lga1700 chipset, so I recommend getting the ThermalRight contact frame (also have a review for it). OVERALL worth it, better if you get it on discount."
BobPage,5,i7-13700k is a nice processor,N/A,"It is what it is, an action packed CPU"
Caswell,5,Smokin'!,N/A,"Nice processor works great, stays cool."
michael berring,5,For those who are on the fence about upgrading from 12th generation Intel,N/A,"Above are screenshots of my Passmark benchmark, both systems exactly the same, except the first picture has the 13700K and the second picture has the 12700K in it. The rest of the components are HX1200, Asus ROG Maximus Hero Z690, Gskill Trident DDR5 F5 6000Mhz, Adata Legend 840 SSD  X2 set up in RAID 0. Vetroo Lurker 240mm AIO water cooling, Power color RX 6900 XT. I run all (P) cores synced at 5300 MHz. Temps idle at about 32 to 35C, hard benchmarking takes it up as high as 88 C once, typically about 75C. Ordinary gaming, tasking takes it to about 45 to 50C.If you are wondering if its worth the upgrade, it is. But considering that my system is one of the fastest in the world with these components, I would have to say that upgrading to a Z790 motherboard is NOT worth it if you already have a Z690.That is all, and good day to you."
Andrew,5,Much needed upgrade,N/A,So I am building my new system starting with I7-13700k upgrading from my pre built Alienware I7-9700k it came out incredible and fast. Love Intel.
Shelley,5,Absolute beast-gaming overkill,N/A,"If you‚Äôre looking at this as a gaming-only processor, you‚Äôll probably get 95% of the gaming performance this offers with the cheaper and cooler i5-13600k. Save your money and put it into a better GPU over buying this because that will actually result in more FPS where this processor (over the 13600k) will not.That being said, this processor is a monster. It‚Äôs a bear to keep cool but it has the performance to back it up. Most stable and speedy system I‚Äôve ever owned. 13th gen might have come out before Ryzen 7000 series, but I still think it‚Äôs the winner.EK‚Äôs Nucleus 360mm AIO did a great job at keeping this CPU under control."
RFM,5,The New Generation,N/A,"This was the first Generation 13 processor we used in a build. Of course the actual build procedure is no different than before so not much can be said for that. Our test show it is about 9% faster than its same-numbered 12th generation.  The other thing we did see from our tests is that again 12th vs.13th the newer processor appears to run about 2¬∞-3¬∞ C lower in temperature under somewhat similar conditions. All in all, obviously we will be doing our building going forward with 13 series processors we can't see justification for anyone taking their i9-12900k out and installing i9-13900k. The gains would probably not be really experienced."
Mina Tharwat,5,Great deal after 14th gen,N/A,There is a very slight non noticeable difference between it and the i9-14900k which makes this one very good deal in terms of valueWorks great and no complaints
J. McGuire,5,Works great.,N/A,Works great.
Cyara,5,"Powerful, stable",N/A,The build is: Intel Core i7 13700K+ MSI MAG Z790 TOMAHAWK WIFI Motherboard DDR5 + MSI GeForce RTX 4060 Ti VENTUS 3X 8G OC + 2x CORSAIR VENGEANCE DDR5 RAM 32GB (2x16GB) 6400MHz CL32 + Cooler Master MasterLiquid PL240 Flux CPU Liquid Cooler = Just a Perfect build!
Zachary Gibson,5,My name is Speed.,N/A,Great processor. Hella fast. Overclock turns this thing into a beast. Top notch silicon!
A. Golden,5,"Lightning fast, but runs hot",N/A,"Amazing CPU, noticed huge improvements in performance almost everywhere (faster load times, higher FPS in games, etc.) Performance was especially noticeable in CPU heavy games such as WoW, that don't require as much GPU power and are heavily bottlenecked by CPU. In cases like those I doubled FPS going from 9th gen to 13th gen Intel.One thing to note: 13th gen Intel is HOT! You may be coming from an older CPU and used to 60-70 C temperatures at max, then you might think you did something wrong when this one hits the lower 90s a lot. That's just how it is. If you're worried about longevity, set an undervolt offset of about -0.10 (preferably in your motherboard's BIOS settings) and the temps will drop by about 10 degree with no loss of stability."
Robert S.,5,Plenty of Power,N/A,"I've never had a problem with intel cpu's, been running the 8086k for years, and now to get the 13700k for the same price with double the cores and threads....you really can't go wrong with intel.  Glad I got this when I did, even when the newer stuff comes out, I'm positive this is future proof for many years to come.  As of now (8/10/23) it is placed 5th on userbenchmarks."
Maroon,5,CPU en ballade,N/A,loved the product
Jaime Samanez Paz,5,Buen producto,N/A,quality product
Tommy Thao,5,Great workstation CPU,N/A,"Great workstation CPU. Upgraded my aging Intel Haswell 4770k workstation to these new, e-core embedded Intel CPUs.Only negative drawback is that these newer Intel CPUs run hot and eat quite a bit of wattage.Should have picked an I5 instead but wanted to future proof my new workstation until 2030.Highly recommend!"
Donald,5,Very Nice Processor,N/A,Runs like a champ.
AlberBohorquez,5,Excelente,N/A,116 cores and 24 threads.  VERY stable even in bench tests (of course with good cooling and RAM
Lianna,5,Awesome CPU,N/A,"Extremely powerful for the money, handled AAA games with ease. Would recommend for anyone‚Äôs PC build."
Emileigh,5,Awesome processor,N/A,"I previously built an 8th gen i7 for gaming and work, relegating my 1st gen i7 to my hobby (ham radio)  after 13 years that mobo started acting up, and I made the decision to build a new computer for gaming and put the 8th gen to my hobby.The 13700K with the durable motherboard I chose is awesome.  It handles the fastest NVMe drives, fastest memory and keeps up with my extremely high end video card.  I really cannot speak highly enough.  I had considered a different brand, and the 12th gen i7, but after two months with the 13700K I can honestly say I could not be happier.Thank you Intel."
Isaac Behage,5,Absolute unit for 1080p-1440p gaming,N/A,"Really powerful cpu for sure, haven't even been able to find a game that limits it out, thermals are beautiful with the h150i elite under heavy loads staying in the 50s-60s. Perfect for 1080p-1440p and even could potentially run some 4k games with the right gpu paired. Overall very happy with the performance!"

Name,Stars,Title,Date,Description
John Wolf,1,Lasted 4 months,N/A,This CPU quit after four months. I cannot get in touch with Amazon customer support nor can I connect with anyone at Intel. Very disappointed to say the least. The CPU was installed according to specs and has never been overclocked nor has the voltage been altered.
David Hoyes,1,Arrived DOA,N/A,This CPU arrived DOA . For all the years I have been building PC's Gaming Rigs and Workstations I have never got a DOA CPU . Mother Boards and Ram sure but not CPU's . This is the first Intel CPU i have bought in nearly a decade and I got a brick a long RMA process because I'm outside the return window and a machine waiting for a CPU that has from what I can tell from other reviews cores that die for any number of reasons .  Bad work Intel . I won't be signing up for more of this .
Amazon Customer,1,"It's junk, don't buy this. It won't boot up my PC!",N/A,Not even worth throwing away money to buy. Stay away from this!
Amazon Customer,1,It's AMAZING!  Except everytime it crashes.,N/A,"The processor, this model of processor, was built with flaws.  To make it function without receiving ""OUT OF VIDEO MEMORY ERRORS"", which makes no sense.  I had high hopes for this processor.  I am terribly disappointed.  I am going to RMA this hunk of metal."
Anthony James Todorov,1,"Useless, throttles with a 1500 custom water cooling loop",N/A,"I'm running 2x 420mm by 60mm radiators with a 4000rpm d5 pump and a high end waterblock and it idles at 55c. Throttles within 30 seconds of running cinebench. I'm so upset that I decided to go intel instead of amd. Literally sunk well over $2000 on aio's and fans and eventually a new case and custom loop just to get NORMAL TEMPERATURES and not throttle nonstop.. and there's been no improvement at all. I've reseated it probably a hundred times by now trying every thermal paste there is, with every method of application. It's not fair that I've had to invest thousands into Intel to be left with a useless machine. Do not buy this chip or anything from Intel."
Ethan Bruning,1,"product is probably good, but the seller is garbage.",N/A,Product will not boot and overheats
Mas,1,Check to make sure your board is compatible!,N/A,"This is my experience, I doubt that this is actually a problem with the processor itself, and more compatibility issue of the motherboard that I put it on, but I expected because it ran on 400 and 500 series motherboards that that meant that since mine is a 400 that it would run on it, I was wrong, the PC would not post when I put this processor on, I tried exchanging for another, and it did the same thing PC would not boot at all, it would go into a turn on then off then on then off then on then off then on then off cycle where nothing would actually show up on the monitor just my case fans would light up and then turn off and then light up and then turn off. So I don't know if the problem is with the processor or if I have a board compatibility issue, but I think I should not have had a board compatibility issue, and I have a 900 W power supply so there's no reason why there wasn't enough power to boot, I also used a liquid cooler so it should have had zero heat problems. I put a 12,900K on my motherboard from a 12700 KF which is what came with the computer, and the 12900K boots just fine. I am running a Lenovo legion t5 Gen 7. Should be compatible I don't see why it wouldn't be, but I have yet to try any other 13th generation processors to find out."
Thomas Lepschies,1,Keine CPU drin,N/A,"Erstmal muss ich sagen das die Lieferung echt fix ging, Termin war f√ºr die darauffolgende Woche Mittwoch angedacht, aber das P√§ckchen kam schon Freitag. Ich dachte mir nur, geil alle Teile zusammen und es kann ans zusammenbauen gehen. Also fing ich an das Mainboard auszupacken , alles sch√∂n zurecht gelegt und wollte dann die CPU auspacken, wunderte mich das die Verpackung schon auf war, ü§î dachte ich, aber egal, weiter geht's. Ich machte die Verpackung wo jetzt die CPU drin sein sollte auf und sah einen Hauch von Nichts üò≥ toll, dachte ich, 630‚Ç¨ weg. Denke mal das sich da jemand im Amazon Lager wie im Selbstbedienungsladen gef√ºhlt hat. Gleich Amazon angerufen und keine 10 min sp√§ter kam die Mail das der Betrag erstattet wird. Alles sehr komisch und √§rgerlich,  aber am Ende doch f√ºr micht noch gut ausgegangen . Hab jetzt nochmal bei einem anderen Anbieter bestellt und hoffe das es da nicht wieder eine b√∂se √úberraschung gibt."
Mohammad Attaran,1,Disappointed with the customer service,N/A,After 3 months it appeared that my processor is faulty. I discussed the issue with Intel support and they happily agreed to replace it with a new one. But I still had to discuss this with the reseller. They have a very bad support and hardly answer my messages time to time with short sentences.
Maria Kwan,1,Faulty product,N/A,Don‚Äôt buy from this seller.  This company sells faulty products.  The courier charge to return the faulty product to USA is very expensive!!
sergio,1,Imballaggio i9 13900k,N/A,The media could not be loaded.
Erik Gerlitz,1,Will be dead on arrival or degrade over months,N/A,"My first review ever. Intel has finally acknowledged this issue, search ""Regarding Reports of 13th/14th Gen Unlocked Desktop Users Experiencing Stability Issues"" on google.For me, worked great for about a month, then slowly started experiencing stability issues. Games would crash and get an occasional blue screen. After about 6 months, there were noticeable stability issues, with many games unable to boot past main menu, causing blue screen on launch, or experiencing frequent crashes. Friends in separate friend groups would always comment on my computer issues, showing bugs and crashes that have no apparent causes.After a year, my PC can only run super smash brothers melee with stability and even chrome tabs are crashing now. Discord has to be run on chrome because the app crashes every 10 seconds, I can't play any games. I had dedicated tens of hours into investigating only to realize it's been the CPU all along. I also had to upgrade my motherboard to accommodate this CPU and now I have to investigate if this CPU has caused irreparable damage to the motherboard. I expect Intel will be facing heavy financial losses due to influx of warranties as the issues become more and more public.Please look up ""Intel 13th and 14th Gen stability"" for more info, or ""Intel Raptor Lake stability"" on Google for further cases. Unacceptable for a company worth over $100B to push out a product like this."

Zev,1,Worst warrenty support i have ever delt with or it doesnt support windows 10 or 11.,N/A,"It worked fine for 6 months, then i start running into Error Code 0xC0000005 with lots of various applications in Windows 11.  I figure it was after an update and they turned on some security thing, and I dissabled all the security stuff and still running into issues.  I reset the OS, still issues, I do a fresh clean install, still issues.  I try replacing the memory, still issues.  I try installing win 11 with a different boot installer, still issues.  I try windows 10.... still issues.  I try reinstalling it 2 more times, still the same issue.I decide to go to Micro Center to have them diagnose the issue, while i am there, their windows 10 install crashes with the same error code.  They take it in, and in 2 days message me saying its the CPU.  They tried the CPU in a different motherboard and the issue still shows up.  So, i go and pick up the machine.I try to file a warrenty claim with Intel, but their login system was broken for a week, so I had to chat with a support person.  We spend 1 hour typing about the issue.  I send him screenshots of the CPU itself, the text from Microcenter, the recepit from Amazon, screenshot of the Bios showing all my hardware information, a screenshot of the recepit from microcenter, a screenshot of the error code.I wait a week or so, i can finally log into Intel website, and i dont see a support ticket.  I open up chat again,  i tell them my ticket and they tell me that it wasnt assigned to an email address.  They assign it and forward the support response to me.And the response says, they cant contact Microcenter to confirm it.  And that its not a CPU issue anyways because that code is due to an OS issue.An OS issue.  I ask them to reiterate their point, because if its an OS issue, that means they dont believe me and Microcenter.  I also pointed out again that i have installed Windows 10 and 11 at least 5 times.... and they respond with, i need documentation from Microcenter.  So, they dont believe me and they believe this is an OS issue still.It has been 11 days and they wont move forward unless I send the documentation from Micro Center now.Works great, but hope you never have to file a warrenty claim because its going to take at least a month and thats if your lucky."
T. S.,1,Do you feel lucky?,N/A,"This I9 chip is very likely guilty of destroying 2 ASUS ROG Maximus Hero Z790 motherboards.  The first motherboard was ordered from Amazon with this chip.  The second was a replacement sent by ASUS for a relatively small fee compared to the cost of the first.  Picture number 1 is the offending chip.  Picture number 2 is the socket of the first motherboard after it destroyed it (picture taken by ASUS service).  Picture number 3 is the socket of the replacement motherboard ASUS sold me cheap AFTER this I9 destroyed it (wife's picture).  Since it arrive 15 Sept, Amazon says they can't help me.  Intel is thinkimng about what they are going to do.  Bottom line:  I'm out $900 for motherboards and Amazon and ASUS have declined to help any more.  We'll see what Intel does.  I've spent ~15 hours dealing with this: setting up and taking apart a computer that still doesn't work (no motherboard and a MB killer CPU), and support calls.  Moral of my story: Unless you feel lucky, DO NOT buy a motherboard and CPU and count on them working together.  Rather, just pay some integrator to sell you a motherboard, CPU, and memory that have been tested to work together."
KetchupSoup,1,Lots of Gaming Instability,N/A,"I saved up for years to upgrade my PC, which I built from scratch to use for streaming. After a couple of months of using this new chip, I started getting constant game/system crashing whenever playing Destiny 2, or Fortnite. Basically has put my livestreaming/content creation job on hold, because of the constant crashing. Here are my specs...MOBO: ASUS Prime Z790-A WiFi 6ECPU: Intel Core i9-13900KGPU: XFX Speedster MERC310 AMD Radeon RX 7900XTRAM: 128GB Corsair Vengeance DDR5 RAM"
Gamer,1,Defunct after a couple months,N/A,"I bought all new parts for my new build. And I wanted a good CPU. Got this one. Long story short, I had bsods, into eternity, slowly troubleshooting and replaced parts. This was the last part I replaced and this was the culprit. Do not buy this chip it will ruin your build."
Unive,1,"Perpetual Heating Issues, BSODs, games crashing.",N/A,"Ive switched out PSUs, MOBOs, SSD's. Ive even sent my 4080 on an RMA process with gigabyte trying to understand where all my problems are coming from and at the end of the day it's this CPU.Ive experienced nothing but an awful time with this thing. I regret buying it, I regret spending all the money on my new build when I should have just went with AMD. In a year or so I am going to try to sell off the 4080 and other parts and just chunk this piece of garbage into a landfill.___The computer is only stable in power saved mode in the power options. With most games that are intensive, as soon as the CPU is needed, stuff just starts crashing. You literally have to throttle this CPU down to have system stability. The windows battery saver mode if you look at the hidden registry files, it alters the CPU by throttling it down. Resulting in poor performance from what should be a high-end build and it's just sad."
Steve,1,Production Problems!,N/A,"I purchased this CPU bundled with the ASUS TUF Gaming Z790-Plus WiFi motherboard. That started me chasing my tail for 3 weeks. I ended up soliciting the help of Geek Squad as they had the spares needed to make a proper evaluation. After 5 motherboards (2 manufacturers) and 4 i9-13900K CPU's. We finally found a winner. According to Geek Squads' advanced support, Intel has had a recent production problem with this CPU. They say it's not uncommon to go through 4 or 5 CPU's before finding a good one. Well I saw it with my own eyes. Intel has always had such a good reputation I was reluctant to reach that conclusion. But apparently this is the case. I understand that previous generations are not affected."
Brian Hagen,1,"Worked great for 4 months, then...",N/A,"Worked fine for 4 months then it started crashing and freezing.  It destroyed the OS kernel and the OS had to be reinstalled.  I finally had to take it to a local computer repair place and $400 later in attempts to diagnose all of the components and fix it, it turns out that this cpu won't work properly with c-states enabled.  C-States tells it to stop sending power to cores when they aren't in use.  This means my computer won't be able to go to sleep or hibernate.  It's either on or off.  They suggested I get the cpu replaced but of course, its past the exchange time."
Alec R.,1,so many problems.,N/A,I have this CPU still because I spent a bunch of money on it. It over heats and overclocks itself. Not stable even after I undervolted and overclocked it. I messed with my bios too to try and help it also got a AIO cooler and new case for it. Nothing works terrible purchase and it has been too long for my protection plan it ran out its a big shame.
Mr. T,1,Dead On Arrival,N/A,"I could not get a signal to o my monitor from my new computer build. Finally took entire computer to professional computer repair shop and it was determined that the brand new Intel CPU chip was D.O.A. Because it took me 31 days to learn how to assemble a computer by watching YouTube videos and then get it diagnosed by a computer shop, I had to eat the cost of this worthless chip. There is no excuse to have such bad quality control on such an expensive item."

Returned the processor per the instructions and the refund was supposed to be issued by the 27th of August (almost 3 weeks) the 27th has arrived and Amazon has changed the refund date and tacked on another 3 days and now says a refund will be issued by the 30th. Enough is enough! I want my money back for an item that didn‚Äôt work! Do I have to reverse the charges with my bank?
Bitronic,1,Disappointed,N/A,The Intel 13th gen CPUs have been a big disappointment. I originally had a faulty 13900KS which intel replaced with a 13900K and they refunded the difference of the 13900KS because they had none in stock. That was a loss of my original savings and no compensation by Intel.Next system will be an AMD for sure.
keli,1,Had to RMA CPU because of constant game crashes,N/A,I am currently in the process of replacing this cpu since mine is defective. Read the threads and do research into how people have constant issues with these crashing. Upgrade to the 14th gen and skip the chance of a defect.

Randall,2,Very unreliable processor,N/A,"Since I bought this processor, I have had nothing but trouble. I wish I'd just returned it, but I had rose-tinted glasses. It couldn't be Intel's fault, I mean, I've had dozens of intel CPUs over the years, and never had a problem. But this thing....How do I know IT is the problem? When I set CPU affinity in Task Manager and limit the number of cores software has access to, everything runs fine. Slicing, games, my frigging web browser even!But if I unlock those applications and go 'all cores', stuf crashes left and right, the CPU bluescreens regularly, simple things like comfyUI crash the browser just by clicking on a node. HellDivers 2 can only be played between 2 and 10 minutes without crashing. All bets are off if I have 4 players.Just avoid this model. Get a different one or wait for the next iterationl."
Dan,2,MUST have good watercooling -- Too Hot,N/A,"I tried this CPU with and without a motherboard contact heat sink + Corsair H100x RGB Elite Liquid CPU.Although baseline is about 33C on HWINFO, when using Cinebench -- it eventually starts thermal throttling after starting at 85CPeaks at over 360W, for just the CPU -- so this CPU needs a professional cooler, as the two fan cooler was working but just couldn't keep up with how insanely hot this thing runs.I tried using everything, from different thermal pastes and liquid metal -- all of which failed.Most people probably buy this CPU and have no idea that it's beeing throttled during benchmarking.I was sadened by all the posts on redit mentioning to undervolt or turn off multicore optimization, lol...Great CPU if you don't care about electricity and have a great cooler."
M.C,2,Faulty product,N/A,It's not Amazon's issue but the processor I bought is faulty. I'm experiencing crashes while playing games. It's so annoying and so time-consuming. I had so many stressful moments because of this.
Bushcrafter1984,2,Heat issues with this 13900k,N/A,"Took me forever to figure this out, but I can't reach rated speeds on my 13900k due to throttling.SP 111/88 = 103Cooling: 170When the throttle happens, both P-cores and E-cores drop, causing performance hits in normal tasks as well as games. ASUS motherboard at default settings attempts to send extreme amounts of voltage to the CPU (1.4+) in order to reach boost rating (no XMP).This has literally been the most difficult processor to reign in heat I've had to deal with in my 30 years of computing, AMD is starting to look good I guess (which is why I switched to and have remained with intel for 20 years, AMD ran hot back in the day). Apparently even the 14900k's are having issues.It's power hungryIt's hotNot enough surface area to cool appropriately without risking your warrantyLiterally every solution I've seen involves doing things Intel recommends against.Intel: Some help would be appreciated."
Bradley Hart,2,Nothing But Issues,N/A,"I've had nothing but issues with this processor. It's a personal heater, causes tons of crashes, and can even blue screen from time to time. I've installed many processors and built plenty of PCs and i've never had any issues. For whatever reason i've had and heard of a lot of issues with the 13th gen. I hope this is only me and a select few rather than the product just being bad. I've always been an Intel and Nvidia user so trust me when I say I really wanted this to live up to the great reviews.Wouldn't recommend using this unless you have a good 360mm AIO."
Sean Bowl Fan,2,Do not get this chip unless you are a data Scientist or something,N/A,"This chip has cooling issues in gaming. Full stop. Really you should be looking at AMD X3D chips if you want the god chips, and if you want to stick with intel for reliability, the i5 does not bottleneck the 4090. If your cooling is TOP NOTCH, you will bottleneck a powerful graphics card via throttling. If you want a lot of coresfor some reason though, its pretty cool."
Cina Galloni,2,Overpriced,N/A,"Performance leaves much to be desired at this price point. Fastest gaming CPU on the planet when I bought it (other than their special edition), but when you‚Äôre paying this much it better predict my every move and leave me with no processing time. Truly absolutely ludicrous pricing, same unreasonable pricing as NVIDIA. Buy a different intel CPU at half the price for a 5-10% performance difference instead. Same chips, different manufacturing luck."

Rip,3,Smokin‚Äô Hot and Not in a Good Way,N/A,Very fast CP.if you can keep it from throttling. Requires at leadt a 360mm AIO to even attempt to cool this thing. Pretty sure even the best air cooler would be overwhelmed. Intel needs to control their power draw and heat. It ois becoming an issue with their high end chips. It‚Äôs also way overpriced for what you get.
Doomsauce,3,Beware the poor quality control.,N/A,"This is an amazing processor, however I went through two defective, factory new, 13900KFs before I got one that actually worked. The errors from the defective chips ranged from flat-out not working to symptoms that resembled defective memory(which it wasn't as I had 3 sets of ram and 4 seperate M.2's to test).Roll your dice and hope you get a good one. Intel RMA took about 3 weeks per defective processor."
Cranky Customer,3,Good CPU!,N/A,"Liked everything about this item except for the packaging.  The CPU was inside the plastic protector but not secured inside the Intel branded box that the manufacturer placed it into.  When I received the package it made a sound like marbles dropping onto a glass top table!  I thought it was the end of the line for the CPU inside.  Wanted to send it back, but thought ahhhh, just give it a chance.  I did and it works fine.  I did take 2 stars for the lack of a decent packaging job by Intel.  For these prices, we are paying for better!"

Srimanth,3,"3.0 out of 5 stars
It can be more efficient I guess",N/A,"It is working almost same as my 10 yr old DELL XPS laptop, swapped with a SATA SSD, and i7 second gen processor. I don't know whats improved. But it's doing its job I guess.. in my 2 weeks of usage I have seen it's temprature rised above 80¬∞C once. Wasn't expecting that from current refined and powerful generations. I am using liquid cooling on top of this. And yet it hit 80¬∞C. What I was doing when that happened was trying to open a game. And one thing that I missed was to disable the integrated graphics because I have dedicated GPU. It was just for a moment the CPU was used during the game launch and after it started using the GPU. But until that switch happened, under less than a minute of CPU usage, it reached to 80¬∞c. I mean since these are premium products, there should be some protection layers blocking such usages, and close the programs instead rather than hitting its performance.But anyways, I disabled the integrated device and then it's all smooth. Everything normal except for that one instance explained above. Parallel processing is still shitty though with Windows OS. Same kind of processors on Mac before Apple silicon came in were working more efficiently. So I guess it's prob with windows OS, but not processors."

Carlos Canales,3,"Amazing processor, but check your CPU power management in BIOS",N/A,"So, first thing's first. This is a genuinely powerful CPU that's been able to handle basically every task that I've thrown at it. It runs demanding tasks like encoding and gaming with ease.Now with that out of the way; Thermals. This thing gets hot, and I mean REALLY hot. If you're going with air cooling I strongly recommend a double tower, six/eight pipe Air cooler like the Corsair A115 or a Cooler Master MA824. If you are going the AIO route, anything LESS than a 360mm AIO will under perform. For that, go with any 360mm AIO from any brand of your choice. If you have the space, go with a 420mm AIO for the best results.Finally, there has been recent reports of CPU degradation and instability when using this CPU. I am using this with an asus ROG STRIX Z790-H motherboard and it basically JUICED the CPU like no tomorrow until I applied intel's Power settings for this CPU. This likely is the cause of the degradation. Be sure to check intel's website for recommended power settings. Also check your motherboard vendor for any bios updates as Intel has confirmed that many motherboard vendors are running the i9 13900k CPU out of intel's specifications.In conclusion here's my personal experience: The CPU functions, but I can not use Asus' AI Overclocking feature as I get a BSOD with the CLOCK_WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT error and apps will randomly crash. You probably shouldn't use any AI assisted overclocking feature if you can help it. Even running this at stock, there is still a substantial amount of performance in this CPU. If you have an older rig and are looking to upgrade your CPU, I would just wait for Meteorlake or just go with AMD.Final note: I am not using a contact frame on my motherboard for my CPU."
IndyToronto,3,Surprisingly Fast but watch out for corner chip escapes,N/A,"We set up multiple computing servers to run heavy video processing algorithms essentially continuously everyday - to make a long story short, we liked how fast this ran compared to the i7-11th gen we had from before.The surprising thing is one day among 8 essentially identical machines, we noticed one desktop that seemed much hotter than the others.  We hooked up measurement of power draw and temperature readings of the CPUs and was shocked that this one was drawing 450W as others were showing < 200W.  And temperature went up to 100C while the others were at 70C.One system had a glitch where if you ran python and import numpy, it would reboot.  We determined the problem was that PSU only supported +12V rail at 20A.  We switched to a 600W PSU that supports +12V @50A and it worked flawlessly.  So watch out that your PSU supplies sufficient amps at +12V.Ordered a replacement, replacement brand new would not boot up.  We swapped back old CPU from, and it boots up but runs hot again.  This one we had to reduce workload to 75% of other systems to cool it down.So 2 out of 10 desktops are defective  This is a huge surprise.  These systems had no GPU, only motherboard, 64GB of DDR5, and an SSD.  Has anyone else seen this?"

elviscera,4,Fast but runs very hot,N/A,"Concerning Intel Core i9-13900KF,I have this CPU with board ASUS ROG Strix Z790-E Gaming WiFi 6E LGA 1700 for gaming usage.  Once I discovered that I had to slow the memory down from the 6600MHz XMP rating to 6200MHz, the board/cpu combo has worked very reliably  (multiple passes of OCCT Gold stress test).  Just checking the XMP II box,  the 6200MHz box and the (so called) AI overclocking box in the bios gives a score of 40K on Cinebench R23 so it's plenty fast -- the loss of 400MHz memory bandwidth isn't a big deal.  I tried various other adjustments but the latter turned out to be sufficiently fast and very reliable.  My current chip has a Silicon Predictor(SP) of 99 (roll of the dice).  I suspect that higher SP levels while possible are rare.I am using a ARCTIC Liquid Freezer II 360  AIO which works OK but the CPU can run hot.  The mother board cooling prediction for said AIO is 155 but that is not really enough for this chip to run all out.  It is easy to get this CPU up to 100C using OCT Power Stress test.  While the CPU might run at 100C for a long time, it will not do it any good and it will not run reliably -- I needed to check the 90C max box in the bios to get it to pass the OCCT power stress test.  I have a RTX 4090 and in the OCCT power test the net system power gets up to 1100W.  Normal gaming so far never gets to such power levels but still worth considering.FWIW, I have had a CPU apparently fail from running the OCCT Power Stress test.  If you want to run this CPU all out with reasonable temps, you really need significant cooling.  I doubt any AIO will work for this.  I suggest an open loop system with something like a Watercool MO-RA3 420 PRO radiator.All said, If you are building a gaming system, you would be just as well served with a ASUS ROG Strix Z690-E and a i9-12900KF CPU.  It will be easier to cool and will save you some money for a better graphics card which will make *much* more difference in most games than the CPU."

There are well documented power issues that Intel and their partners have with the 13th, 14th gen.

Snowstorm,4,Too hot,N/A,This processor produces too much heat. Forget obout overclocking (I tried Intel utility). In overclocked mode the processor consumes over 300W and heats to over 100C even with the best cooler.

Nick B,5,Insane performance,N/A,"Cinebench R23 scores: 40,345 MT / 2,284 STUpgrading from the Ryzen 5950X, this processor has some significant uplift, particularly in the single-core speed. Minimal overclocking headroom as Intel has already milked 90% of the performance on stock settings. However, with some tweaking, you're likely to get up to 6.2 Ghz boost behavior for single-core loads, and bump up the all-core boost to 5.7 Ghz (up from 5.5 Ghz stock). With some further tweaking of the voltage-frequency curve, you could probably tweak this even further. I'm not a big fan of all-core overclocks on these type of processors, as you will lose the boosting single-core speed. In my opinion, this processor shines for gaming because of its single-core boosting performance.Memory controller has been significantly improved over Alder Lake. I was easily able to get my DDR5 6400 XMP profile running without any tweaking. I'm pretty sure this can be easily pushed further, but it seems like around 6400 Mhz memory is the roughly the sweet spot in terms of price vs performance.Very power hungry, but despite the bad reputation from reviewers, the power consumption can be easily tamed. If you run power limits unlocked, you will likely be thermal limited due to thermal throttling at 100c. However, you don't need unlocked power limits - you're talking about a very small 5-10% performance uplift but using >100W more power to achieve this. I would suggest running it at stock power limits, or unlocked power limits but seriously consider undervolting.On a final note, I wouldn't consider getting the rumored 6.0 Ghz version of the 13900K in the future. The current 13900K can easily be pushed to >6 Ghz boost speeds and will save you money."
s,5,good . temp issues are overblownw,N/A,"i upgraded from 5900xt. I got the msi board z690 -a for 159, and this the 13900kf. I ‚Äòve been wanting a cpu with an IGPU for years, but couldn‚Äôt justify the price increase on the gpu version. I actually use a dgpu but it really is convenient, and they can be used to accelerate some work. Again, before you judge i'm using this for work, productivity. NOT gaming. I would spend 200 for a gaming cpu.my use case is productivity. i‚Äôm a developer, and this is the sole reason i upgraded. I was fighting windows freezing and slowing down during a lot of my workflows. I use wsl intellj, docker, react apps java etc, often at the same time. It‚Äôs pretty noticeable the improvement. It really helped.  Like that i could use ddr4 for now since the boards are about 150 it was acceptable.Heat: The cpu gets a bad reputation due to heat and wattage. I put this in the bucket frankly that amd got as well. I mean it‚Äôs fine they are using as much power as needed to maximize perf. I limited the cpu to 250w, and it runs on a d15 cooler than my 5900, Full load can get up to high 80c, but working is 30‚Äôs. you lose very little perf by running it more in the zone. I don't know about other boards but that msi one sure makes it easy and the price if right.About the cpu: it has a ton of cores, I didn't need to buy ddr5--  i need quite a lot of ram and it still costs too much for the benefit it provides in my workload. The memory controller on 13gen is far better than ryzen 5000 series. I couldn't before get my ddr4 stable at 4000 on the 5900x and it did it on the intel one immediately. Indeed i was even able to tighten up the timings just a touch. So modern processors (and i'd assume the amd ones as well) have made welcome improvements to memory support. Id' say if you don't need as much ram say 32gb, and you don't have ddr4 already to tide you over i'd consider getting ddr5 though.  I mean nothing is cheaper than what you have and 4k speed is fine. If i had nothing or maybe some old ram i'd go w/ ddr5.Price: For 570 it‚Äôs decent deal here. It is more than i love spending, but for what you get it is a lot better than what amd is offering at the time i write this which was 700.I do wish intel supported board reuse down the line, but that even can. be overblown (to an extent, and only an extent) though it's a selling feature to me frankly reuse!! I had to really think about that. I don't understand why intel is so stubborn on this subject.  with my amd cpu i went from 2700x to 5900x and the board went from a 470 to 570 because i waned more io and better pcie but i also gave that board to my kid and upgraded it one time. With intel especially I mean i just buy cheap boards anyway and upgrade more because there are a ton of features that get added half the time. I usually try to spend about 150 on a board, though it. is getting harder but it would be more my preference. I 'm not really onboard with the 600 motherboards. Is there a  300 one in-between i guess so but that's equally unappealing to me esp w/ out the upgrade.Tips/A rant if you will: trust me on this that msi board for 159 is so amazing. It really works great. don‚Äôt worry about the vrm. that‚Äôs also very overblown too. you can go calculate the amperage this will not come close. ALso msi is a great brand and the bios is easy to navigate. If you want fancy audio buy a dac that you can reuse and plug into usb and keep reusing it. Just think about what you really need in there. The msi board has a nice selection of pcie slots and well placed nvme. I use multiple gpu one nvidia gpu quatro for encoding (its a small one) and and amd one 6900 i bought for 570 for gaming.

Barry,5,"Would never buy it again, but really glad I did.",N/A,"This thing runs SO HOT. It literally tries to destroy itself.A lot of people underclock it to avoid the heat issues, but I instead just monitor it closely.Make certain you have a strong CPU cooler. Under load (GTA5 for instance) it absolutely will hit 90c+.I mostly use it for work (npm), where it shines. Dropped my built times from a Ryzen 7 from 15/20 minutes down to 5 minutes, which is Massive.I LOVE this cpu, but it is 100% a room heater. If you live in a cold climate and can open a window, this thing will Love your house. If you live in south texas and it's summer time, good luck!"

Customer 2023,5,Fast,N/A,"It's fast, and works better than my space heater for keeping the desk undersides warm. Too warm, really.UPS says the computer is using 575 watts during the CPU stress test, about 175 watts at idle. TPU is 253w ... so with the 80%+ PS inefficiency, 300w makes sense.When using the 3080 GPU with the i9 CPU ... well, the heat coming from the case is similar to a 1000w space heater, really. Now reconsidering my choice for only an 850w PS. 1000w would probably be a better idea for this beast.As for speed. That's relative. But I am coming from an i9-7900x, and this is 3x faster, and it feels 3x faster. Memory is slower, (4ch vs 2ch) -- so I had to use DDR5-6400 to get a similar memory bandwidth. Lost some latency, but the overall effect is the thing still seems plenty fast.I dislike the way the CPU case instantly jumps to 100c -- no thermal mass what-so-ever in the CPU case. Or I have a bad CPU without whatever filler Intel puts between the die and the case.In any case, Intel needs to allow for more thermal mass to reduce these thermal stresses of instantaneous temp changes. Has to be stressing the silicon and lead to more thermal stress failures."

john g.,5,Beast of a CPU,N/A,I have found the KF models overclock a bit better. This is a beast of a CPU and puts AMD fan boys to shame. This one is able to do 6.0 GHZ all core at 1.40 volts with DDR5 running at 8000 mt's CL32.  Currently the best CPU you can buy at time of writing this.  Pair it with a 4090 and you have the fastest 4K gaming PC out.

Jason C.,5,Upgraded from an 8th gen,N/A,"These CPU's are throttled by temps & bottle necked by how good your CPU cooler is. Once 100 degrees is hit performance is throttled to maintain-but-not-exceed that temperature.  In heavy workloads that can happen almost immediately, so the more heat your cooler can dissipate the longer the CPU can sustain faster speeds.  A completely bottom-tier air-cooled noctua is sufficient to keep this CPU happy and you'd probably never know you're leaving some performance on the table.I upgraded from an 8th gen and the performance gain is huge."

It works really good, very very fast, and can ***multi task heavy software like they're nothing*** and with a push pull AIO it averages around 28*C and when I'm gaming it stays around 50-40*C with graphics maxed out. Much love and gratitude to Intel! This works great with gaming and also data science, which work is the main reason I bought this. I also used the Thermal Grizzly - KryoSheet (38x38x0,2mm) for this as well so I don't have to worry about paste drying up on my i9 <3 and lemmy tell you it fits PERFECTLY and pairs well with a CPU contact frame too, and after almost half a year I've yet to have any problems, only good results."

Elijah Stephens,5,Great CPU,N/A,"So I am no tech guru or anything.  I cannot delve into the technical nuances of this cpu like some can.  What I can tell you is this.  The i9-13900k has significantly increased my productivity.  Being able to run multiple CPU heavy applications completely changed the way I work.  Yes I know this CPU runs notoriously hot, but it seems a good quality AIO tames it well.  I have the 13900k running on an Gigabyte Z790 Aorus Master X motherboard with 128 gigs of ram and I use the NZXT Kraken 360 Elite to cool it.  The Kraken Elite does manage the heat well and my systems idles at 28-29 degrees.  This CPU is way overkill for a gamer, but for someone like me that does a lot of 3D modeling and rendering, its great.  I do have the cpu slightly overclocked using the Intel Extreme Tuning Utility in automatic overclock.  I have not had any crashes and havent noticed any thermal throttling at all with this setup."

Nabil,5,Worth it,N/A,"This processor is a beast especially paired with gtx 4090 graphics card. I can edit videos and play games both at 4K settings together no problem and it doesn‚Äôt generate that much heat either. I previously had a 2080ti paired with 6900k and was very happy with it until everyone was transitioning to 4K so sadly I had to retire my old build. Just a heads up to anyone who plans to pair 13900k with 4090, don‚Äôt be a smartass and try to put it in small case, you will regret it later. I personally recommend big case with high airflow like fractal design torrent mid size atx but if you don‚Äôt want to spend too much money on graphics card and happy with getting something like 4060 then you can get the nano version of fractal torrent. Good luck gamers and editors. Just remember if gaming is the only thing you do then no point spending this much just go a step down on processor. AMD processors are better if gaming is the only thing you do."

Aerie,5,Indescribably good,N/A,"Its so good, and that makes sense since its top of the line right now (imagine that.) Going from my 9900k to this was like a spiritual enlightening but ALSO I must add this is totally unnecessary unless youll be working with heavy loads, unreal engine, 4k video editing and streaming, 4k gaming, or anything that requires overclocking.Buying this bad boy will future proof your computer for now, BUT there are very few people who NEED this kind of cpu. If you‚Äôre shopping for your build right now and considering this, if it‚Äôs in the budget and you want something that‚Äôll handle literally whatever you want then yes, this is great. But just remember, whatever you want might not be as intense as this thing accounts for.Now that I‚Äôve warned you about not needing this; let me just say how happy I am that I got it. I do a lot of 4k editing and streaming and there is no issue, runs smoothly and efficiently (does get hot though) if you‚Äôve got a good cooler on this then you‚Äôll be good to go for a long time."

Pierre Aubert Espenan,5,Over clock at your risk,N/A,"I bought two of these from Amazon after one from another vendor failed to POST.  Both worked the first time.  Do you need 24 cores for games?  Most games use 4 or 6 cores max, so probably not.  Video editing can benefit from the extra cores.  Intel supports XMP (extreme memory profile) and this processor is unlocked (it can be overclocked).  Overclocking increases the power consumption and heat; therefore, one needs a robust cooling solution.  Overclocking can void your warranty which is strange since Intel allows and even promotes overclocking with the Intel Extreme Tuning Utility.  I have the NZXT Kraken x 73 RGB liquid cooler.  With the NZXT CAM software you can see the CPU (and GPU) temperatures and control the fan speeds, reducing the risk of damaging the processor.  While idling (at 5.5 GHz) the CPU temperature is 30 C.  Under a 50% load or overclocked the temperatures are below 60 C.  Pros: Good for video editing Cons: A bit pricey for a gaming computer.  Don't overclock without monitoring temperatures to keep below 60 C."
RTXGamer,5,Flagship 13th Gen CPU!,N/A,"As per benchmarks, this CPU performs way better than AMD 7950x3D. Although, you will just get 3-4 frames higher while gaming in AMD 7950x3D CPU but what's the point? Intel is still leading in single core score! Power consumption is almost same. Intel is Apple and AMD is Android. End of story!"

Joaquin,5,"Excellent, beware it does not come with a FAN",N/A,"Excellent processor. It is a beast in gaming and in productivity, for the price I believe is unrivaled. Beware that you should separately buy a CPU Cooler because it does not come with one.Also beware that most Motherboards nowadays put no restraints to this processor in the BIOS, so they let it draw unlimited power and with that comes a very hot temperature limit. For example I'm using an 360mm AIO cooler and with the stock motherboard settings of my AORUS ELITE AX when running cinebench it reaches 100¬∞C within 12 seconds of starting. Of course this temperature is only seen in stress tests and never during games (there, the max I've seen the CPU get is 67¬∞C) but is something to be aware of.All in all happy with this beast"
Timothy,5,This thing is a beast!,N/A,"Probably more than what I need for gaming, maybe I should have gotten a 13700k instead to run a little cooler.  This gets HOT on my Dark Rock Pro 4.

Chris,5,The 2023 rolls royce of PC processors. Probably Not for you Though,N/A,"If it have the money to spare and want a processor that'll last you at least 5 years (and are a power user like I am) its a good choice. But most people say the advantages over the 13700k aren't worth it to most users.If you're just using the PC as a high-end gaming rig an i7-13700k is more than enough even with a 4090 GPU. This processor is designed to benefit more advanced users so I'd save the 150$ and get the cheaper 13700k. Also this processor is notoriously hot, so a beefy noctua air cooler or preferably a 280mm+ watercooler AIO is necessary (especially for overclocking)."

Fast install onto a Supermicro Board x13SAE-f with server memory with IPMI for remote access or an Asus Board such as Z690-f with DDR5 where you can buy an IPMI attachment, and it throttles rather than crashes when it overheats. Or just for gaming and office use this CPU beats everything else to date.  Buy one now and if you have an i9-12900K or KF sell it. Pay attention to the necessary new BIOS install. Not one crash to date but occasional throttling down when stressed as CPU temperature gets too high occurs now and again but not very often and sure stronger Air Fan or water cool fix that if it bothers you.

Jonathan D Drover,5,Fast and hot,N/A,"I use it for computation (not games) with a noctua d15 (1 fan). On all cores (some openmp stuff I wrote) it goes 5.1GHz on the performance cores and 4.1GHz on the efficient cores (in a 23C corner of a room). The temp moves between 90 and 100 C. How I handle that, emotionally, is to have enough in my bank account to get a 13600k overnighted. Having said that, I've been at it for a little over a month and there has not been a glitch. Paired with an asus strix 790-e."
Stephen M,5,"Stupid fast, feels like it‚Äôll last",N/A,"I seriously doubt I‚Äôll be replacing this in the next several years, if even that. This thing is a beast and handles everything you throw at it.I‚Äôve put it through all of the usual hoops and it barely seems to notice. I‚Äôve set it up with the Arctic Liquid Freezer II 420 A-RGB to deal with the heat and it handles that just fine.Worth your time and money, not a bad choice at all."
Dannydan,5,You want to have an overkill cpu?,N/A,"Have been using this for less than a week. Amazing cpu, easy to install in your motherboard. Package appears more simpler compared to older model.Question: do you want an over built, beast of a cpu that you will likely not use to its full potential, but want the best of the best and your willing to pay a small premium compared to the slower model, but you're not some simp that wants something good but wants to dominate and laugh because you're cpu is better than all the ones out there?If the answer is yes, than please get this."
Saya,5,Incredibly Powerfull!,N/A,Just installed this in my new build and I have to say it is AMAZING! My one warning to anyone inexperienced with the newer CPUs is be prepared for the heat. After a lot of work I was finally able to get this down to an average of 30 - 40 degrees Fahrenheit during light loads. When under a heavy load such as Cyberpunk at max everything at 4k. I get about 70 - 79 degrees Fahrenheit. This beast is HOT! but utterly incredible in its performance.
Jerry,5,No issues with install into original 1.1 Firmware ASRock Z790 Steel Legend Motherboard,N/A,"No issues with install into original 1.1 Firmware ASRock Z790 Steel Legend MotherboardUpdated firmware, after Windows install, to 7.04 (latest at time of writing this) and again no issues.  The 7.04 firmware for that board does have Intel ME updates for this processor, so recommended.As to the CPU itself, as all other reviews state, it's the fastest and best for the price.Paired with the noted ASRock board, lots of power limit unlocking options available to set per your cooler capability."
Gary,5,Latest and greatest CPU,N/A,"Upgraded form an i7 to this i9 CPU. Of course the MB also had to be upgraded, but while worth it.  The chip runs at a cool at 36c when not gaming and 56c when gaming (at least 3-4hrs)."
D. S,5,Fast and smooth performance,N/A,"Finally,  after nearly 7 years,  I decided to upgrade my rig.  I was rocking out the i7-7700K, so going from that to the i9-13900K is INSANE!  The difference in operations and performance results cannot be overstated.  Yes,  this cpu likes to run hot.  But with good cooling and nice airflow,  this cpu will handle whatever you throw at it.  I'm glad I finally took the leap to upgrade to this gem."
Dale E. Thompson,5,Amazing.,N/A,"I‚Äôm replacing my old Haswell i7-4770 PC with a new one with this CPU. It‚Äôs at least 7 or 8 times faster on multithreaded tasks. Probably 4 or 5 times faster than my work i7 9000 series. You can under lock it to reduce the wattage, but it‚Äôs already less watts at idle than the Ryzen 9 7950.  Moore‚Äôs law isn‚Äôt dead yet!"
liuyangs,5,Excellent,N/A,Excellent!!!!!
Matt,5,An absolute gaming monster,N/A,"Upgraded  from the  i7-4790k, no more stuttering 40-100 frame increase in games  handles ultra no sweat."
Roland,5,My Best PC for the next 3-5 years,N/A,"Having all these with my Noctua NH-D15S and Rtx 3080ti, it's rock solid! Cinebench Gave 32k+ score. A little bit of tweak and I'm good.. What's important is the games I play. Big improvement from z590 hero , i9 11900 non k it replaced. Now I just have to sell it. Even though the 70003d series came. I'm still an Intel user. Worth the money if u can afford it."
Toyman,5,Just the best,N/A,"Runs a bit hot, but clearly the performance keade4 (until next month) when the i9-14900k comes out"
Shannon,5,"Good processor.. pricey sure, but hard to beat",N/A,Try it and you won't be sorry. Great CPU.
ermacpd,5,"Wow, just WOW",N/A,"I know you can't see this under the cooler, but this is just an amazing CPU. Its SOO fast, and runs like a champ with the AIO cooler I am using. I do not know if just a fan would work as well personally, but the AIO I have is solid on this. 17 hours straight gaming, no crashes. Very amazed and pleased with this."
cwwjr1681,5,Great CPU! Not as Hot as people Say,N/A,This doesnt run anywhere near as hot as people claim or maybe I just got a good CPU bin and cooler. Using the Arctic Liquid Freezer ii 360.
Maul,5,"A monstrosity of a CPU, just wish it had some more thermal headroom",N/A,"At stock 5.5/4.3 with around 1.25v under load, I'm still getting well over 90c in certain stress tests with a Liquid Freezer II 360. You basically have to have a custom loop in order to properly overclock this thing, unless you want to use restrictive power limits which reduce performance. Thankfully, 5.5/4.3 GHz is already overkill in terms of single and multi-core performance, and beats everything else out there."
Reviewer 747,5,A beast,N/A,"A real beast. Overkill most of the time, but awesome when you need it. Unfortunately, not all software can take advantage of so many cores, but at least,  the impressive 5.8 Ghz is a consolation prize when only one or two cores are used, making the task take less time than other processors would need."
Hook'nBull,5,Fast,N/A,"My last build was for an i7-6700K and GTX 1080, so this w/a Radeon RX 6950 XT is just astonishing.  For now, it's cooled by a Noctua NH-U12A (nice air cooler) w/temps idling in high 30s and pushing 70s under bench load.  Hot spots are in the mid 90s, but a custom loop is in the works for overclocks and gaming.  Great processor!"
Matt,5,Sheeesh,N/A,This processor is for a high end if you are tryna build or on the process of buying components. I highly recommend you to buy this!
